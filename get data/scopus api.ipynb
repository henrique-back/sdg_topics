Today, the phreatic groundwater is mostly brackish with some lenses of freshwater floating on top of more saline water. This water, although impossible to use as drink-water or for irrigation, is still important to guarantee the health of wetland habitats and especially of the roman historical and coastal pine forests of Ravenna. With the objective of defining the flow pattern within the aquifer and the exchange between surface and ground water, we characterized the temperature distribution in the shallow subsurface by means of a dense network of piezometers.

Heat pumps are able to extract heat during the winter and dissipate it during the summer. The temperature of the groundwater in the top layer of the aquifer (surficial zone) is sensitive to the changes in atmospheric temperature throughout the year whereas the temperature of the deeper groundwater follows the geothermal gradient (geothermal zone). One of the scopes of the project is to discover at what depth is located the geothermal zone, so that the aquifer has a constant temperature throughout the year. A constant temperature is needed for storage of heat at low enthalpy. The thickness of the surficial zone and the temperature at the top of the geothermal zone are essentially related to land use, distance from the sea, sediment type, and amount of interaction between surface and groundwater. A knowledge of these factors allows to better exploit the geothermal potential of the aquifer when choosing the optimal placement of the heat pumps.\",\"citedby-count\":\"0\",\"authkeywords\":\"Coastal aquifers | Groundwater/surface-water relations | Low enthalpy geothermal energy | Ravenna | Salinization.\"},{\"@_fa\": \"true\", \"prism:url\":\"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84871362577\",\"dc:title\":\"Landscape and weather controls on fine-scale calcareous fen hydrodynamics\",\"dc:creator\":\"Duval T.P.\",\"prism:publicationName\":\"Hydrology Research\",\"prism:coverDate\":\"2012-12-26\",\"prism:doi\":\"10.2166/nh.2011.127\",\"dc:description\":\"Calcareous fens are species-rich peatlands thought to form at discrete alkaline groundwater discharge points. Here the spatial and temporal variability in the peat pore-water hydrodynamics at a fine (plot) scale of three calcareous fens in southern Ontario was investigated over three growing seasons to evaluate the sensitivity of these wetlands to weather fluctuation and landscape position. Only a small area of the fens demonstrated patterns of groundwater upwelling, and positive vertical hydraulic gradients (VHG) were low, peaking at 0.1. Local decreases in saturated hydraulic conductivity generated areas of pore-water over-pressuring in the peat profile through much of the fens. Several areas were subjected to large negative VHG (max=-0.2), causing sustained groundwater recharge. In this study the strength of the connection to the principal source area of water (alkaline stream) determined the pattern and variability of calcareous fen peat hydrodynamics amongst three growing seasons differing markedly in precipitation. The range of pore-water hydrodynamics evident in this study provides evidence for the processes controlling the sensitivity of calcareous fens to climate and land-use change. A conceptual model linking calcareous fen landscape position to weather- and climate-induced hydrodynamic variability is presented to guide management of these biodiverse ecosystems. \\xc2\\xa9 IWA Publishing 2012.\",\"citedby-count\":\"5\",\"authkeywords\":\"Hydraulic conductivity | Hydraulic head | Hydrogeomorphic setting | Precipitation | Vertical hydraulic gradient | Wetland\"},{\"@_fa\": \"true\", \"prism:url\":\"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84872620695\",\"dc:title\":\"A least-square solver to estimate vertical groundwater velocity using subsurface temperature profile\",\"dc:creator\":\"Dong L.\",\"prism:publicationName\":\"Advances in Civil Engineering and Building Materials - Selected Peer Reviewed Papers from 2012 2nd International Conference on Civil Engineering and Building Materials, CEBM 2012\",\"prism:coverDate\":\"2012-12-21\",\"dc:description\":\"The subsurface heat is transported convectively by themoving groundwater, consequently subsurface temperature profiles are used to estimate vertical groundwater velocities.

Permafrost-driven changes in groundwater discharge will alter the flux of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in rivers, yet little is known about the chemical composition and reactivity of dissolved organic matter (DOM) of groundwater in permafrost settings. Here, we characterize DOM composition of winter flow in 60 rivers and streams of the Yukon River basin to evaluate the biogeochemical consequences of enhanced groundwater discharge associated with permafrost thaw. DOC concentration of winter flow averaged 3.9 \\xc2\\xb1 0.5 mg C L-1, yet was highly variable across basins (ranging from <1 to >20 mg C L-1). In comparison to the summer-autumn period, DOM composition of winter flow had lower aromaticity (as indicated by specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm, or SUVA254), lower hydrophobic acid content, and a higher proportion of hydrophilic compounds (HPI). Fluorescence spectroscopy and parallel factor analysis indicated enrichment of protein-like fluorophores in some, but not all, winter flow samples. The ratio of DOC to dissolved organic nitrogen, an indicator of DOM biodegradability, was positively correlated with SUVA254 and negatively correlated with the percentage of protein-like compounds. Using a simple two-pool mixing model, we evaluate possible changes in DOM during the summer-autumn period across a range of conditions reflecting possible increases in groundwater discharge. Across three watersheds, we consistently observed decreases in DOC concentration and SUVA254 and increases in HPI with increasing groundwater discharge. Spatial patterns in DOM composition of winter flow appear to reflect differences in the relative contributions of groundwater from suprapermafrost and subpermafrost aquifers across watersheds.

These opposing trends could be viewed as paradoxical, given that several studies suggest that increased annual precipitation will equate to increased annual groundwater recharge, and therefore increased summertime flow. To gain insight on mechanisms behind these potential changes, we rely on a calibrated, integrated surface and groundwater model to simulate climate impacts on surface water/groundwater interactions using 12 general circulation model projections of temperature and precipitation from 2010 to 2100, and evaluate the interplay between snowmelt timing and other hydrologic variables, including streamflow, groundwater recharge, storage, groundwater discharge, and evapotranspiration. Hydrologic simulations show that the timing of peak groundwater discharge to the stream is inversely correlated to snowmelt runoff and groundwater recharge due to the bank storage effect and reversal of hydraulic gradients between the stream and underlying groundwater. That is, groundwater flow to streams peaks following the decrease in stream depth caused by snowmelt recession, and the shift in snowmelt causes a corresponding shift in groundwater discharge to streams. Our results show that groundwater discharge to streams is depleted during the summer due to earlier drainage of shallow aquifers adjacent to streams even if projected annual precipitation and groundwater recharge increases. These projected changes in surface water/groundwater interactions result in more than a 30% decrease in the projected ensemble summertime streamflow. Our findings clarify causality of observed decreasing summertime flow, highlight important aspects of potential climate change impacts on groundwater resources, and underscore the need for integrated hydrologic models in climate change studies. \\xc2\\xa9 2012.

Groundwater is rapidly depleting and sea water intrusion is occurring in the main coastal aquifers. Providing water for the expanding domestic and tourism sectors, while maintaining the agricultural sector, is becoming a critical issue. Complicating matters of water management, the island has been divided since 1974 into the Republic of Cyprus, the internationally recognized government, and the \\'Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus\\', which is recognized only by Turkey. However, the island\\'s water resources do not conform to map lines and shared infrastructure predates the division, creating unique challenges for the island\\'s two communities. With objectives to enhance bi-communal ties and address common water shortages, a feasibility study was recently performed to identify opportunities for reuse of 30,000 cubic metres per day of treated effluent generated by the New Nicosia Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP). The WWTP is being constructed to replace the Mia Milia/Haspolat WWTP, which services both the Turkish Cypriot community (TCC) and Greek Cypriot community (GCC) of the Nicosia area. The project involved transmitting treated effluent to TCC and GCC, benefiting both communities. The study scope included identifying opportunities for reuse, and identifying and assessing water storage and conveyance alternatives. \\xc2\\xa9 IWA Publishing 2012.\",\"citedby-count\":\"2\",\"authkeywords\":\"Agriculture | Bi-communal | Distribution | Reuse | Stakeholder | Storage\"},{\"@_fa\": \"true\", \"prism:url\":\"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84894199235\",\"dc:title\":\"Planning infrastructural measures for controlling saltwater intrusion in a coastal aquifer by Global Interactive Response Surfaces: The Nauru island case study\",\"dc:creator\":\"Castelletti A.\",\"prism:publicationName\":\"iEMSs 2012 - Managing Resources of a Limited Planet: Proceedings of the 6th Biennial Meeting of the International Environmental Modelling and Software Society\",\"prism:coverDate\":\"2012-12-01\",\"dc:description\":\"Infiltration galleries and scavenger wells are usually constructed to control pumping based saltwater intrusion in coastal aquifers. The optimal allocation of these infrastructures can be decided by solving a multi-objective optimization problem balancing availability of fresh water supply and installation/operation costs, where the effects of different design options on the planning objectives are simulated through a high fidelity model of the flow and transport processes. The incorporation of these simulation models within an optimization-based planning framework is not always straightforward because of the computational requirements of the model itself and the computational limitations of the optimization algorithms. In this paper we explore the potential for the Global Interactive Response Surface (GIRS) methodology to overcome these technical limitations. The GIRS methodology is used to recursively build a non-dynamic emulator of the processbased model that maps the design options into the objectives values and can be used in place of the original model to more quickly explore the design option space. The approach is used to plan infrastructural interventions for controlling saltwater intrusion and ensuring sustainable groundwater supply for Nauru, a Pacific island republic in Micronesia. GIRS is used to emulate a SEAWAT density driven groundwater flow-and-transport simulation model. The evaluation results show the potential applicability of the proposed approach for optimal planning of coastal aquifers.\",\"citedby-count\":\"3\",\"authkeywords\":\"Groundwater | Optimization | Response surface | Salt intrusion\"},{\"@_fa\": \"true\", \"prism:url\":\"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84894190014\",\"dc:title\":\"iEMSs 2012 - Managing Resources of a Limited Planet: Proceedings of the 6th Biennial Meeting of the International Environmental Modelling and Software Society\",\"prism:publicationName\":\"iEMSs 2012 - Managing Resources of a Limited Planet: Proceedings of the 6th Biennial Meeting of the International Environmental Modelling and Software Society\",\"prism:coverDate\":\"2012-12-01\",\"dc:description\":\"The proceedings contain 385 papers.

AR4 \\\\\"is the largest and most detailed summary of the climate change situation ever undertaken, involving thousands of authors from dozens of countries\\\\\". It also states that climate change will affect the world\\'s health and macro-scale economies. The need to adapt to future climatic conditions will be especially challenging in coastal regions, where sea level rise, droughts, and increased tides will lead to more frequent and longer duration seawater intrusions into estuaries, affecting drinking water supplies. This paper describes research performed partially under Water Research Foundation Project No. 4285 into how coastal water supplies might be impacted. Two systems that supply fresh water to several municipalities in South Carolina and Georgia were chosen for study - The Lower Savannah River in the vicinity of the City of Savannah, and the Pee Dee / Waccamaw Rivers and the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway in the vicinity of the Grand Strand / Myrtle Beach area. The research used modified versions of estuary models that had originally been developed for other applications. The \\\\\"Savannah model\\\\\" was developed for predicting salinity intrusion impacts caused by a proposed deepening of Savannah Harbor on the freshwater portion of the Savannah River. As part of the relicensing process for six hydroelectric facilities on the Pee Dee River by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the \\\\\"Pee Dee model\\\\\" was developed to determine how hydroelectric operations affect salinities at coastal intakes, which had experienced episodes of seawater inundation. Both models have unique features: 1) they were calibrated with 20 years of data that included near-historically low inflows and high sea levels caused by severe droughts and hurricanes like those anticipated from climate change; 2) they were developed using advanced, multivariate, multi-spectral artificial neural network-generated empirical modeling techniques that make them significantly more accurate than conventional mechanistic models over the widely ranging input conditions; and 3) they are deployed as Excel\\xe2\\x84\\xa2 spreadsheet programs so that they easily disseminated and used by all stakeholders. The initial models runs were predominantly parametric, i.e., input sea levels and riverine flows are ranged incrementally. AR4 predicts sea level increases of approximately 1/2 to 2 feet, excluding the melting of glacial ice in Greenland and Antarctica. This alone translates into doubling to quadrupling the frequency and duration of seawater intrusion events. The research also includes precipitation change scenarios predicted by a Global Circulation Model (GCM) that were \\\\\"downscaled\\\\\" to the study regions. \\xc2\\xa9 2012 American Water Works Association AWWA WQTC Conference Proceedings.\",\"citedby-count\":\"0\"},{\"@_fa\": \"true\", \"prism:url\":\"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84883569579\",\"dc:title\":\"Using the improved White method to quantify groundwater evapotranspiration\",\"dc:creator\":\"Li H.B.\",\"prism:publicationName\":\"Geological Bulletin of China\",\"prism:coverDate\":\"2012-12-01\",\"dc:description\":\"Ecosystems that depend on groundwater are widely distributed in arid and semi-arid areas.

The main research line concerning this problem is to develop principles and criteria of acceptable groundwater withdrawal by neighbouring countries with compliance with environmental limitations. This includes groundwater protection from depletion and contamination, development of constant groundwater deposit models applied in border regions of neighbouring countries in order to determine groundwater balance elements of certain hydrodynamic flows, their internal interaction and interaction with surface water. Estimation of potential groundwater shared use based on large scale assessment and mapping of its sustained yield with regard to groundwater protection from contamination is also of importance. Determination of prospects for groundwater use and withdrawal management is always connected with the problems of exploitation restrictions in accordance with different criteria. The latter may be both internal and external. Among internal criteria are limitations of hydrogeological and hydrodynamic operation conditions, such as groundwater recharge rate, tolerance dynamic level lowering throughout estimated period, risk of non-standard groundwater being drawn up to a water intake, and others. The external criteria that can restrict groundwater use are related to possible impacts of a planned water extraction upon different environmental components including river run-off, suppression or death of vegetation due to excessive lowering of shallow groundwater level in the upper unconfined aquifer; activisation of karst and suffusion processes; earth surface subsidence, etc. The main tasks of hydrogeological investigations are the following: \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Determination of admissible limits of groundwater extraction in each of boundary countries in order to prevent water reserves depletion in neighbouring countries. \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Regional evaluation of natural groundwater resources of an exploited aquifer. \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Assessment of a groundwater pollution hazard in transboundary aquifers and development of joint recommendations preventing such pollution.

During due-diligence surveys for invasive plants, field botanists identified an undocumented calcareous fen and associated state-listed wetland plants along the route of Enbridge\\'s LSr and Alberta Clipper pipelines in northwest Minnesota. Calcareous fens are rare peat-accumulating wetlands dominated by groundwater discharge, a high mineral content, and are protected by state law. Their hydrology and chemistry provide an environment for a suite of state-listed plants that are specifically adapted and unique to calcareous fens. By state statute, calcareous fens may not be filled, drained, or otherwise degraded by any activity unless the Commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) authorizes the activity under an approved Fen Management Plan. The proposed LSr and Alberta Clipper Pipeline route in the area was collocated with existing Enbridge pipelines installed before the fen was identified. State regulatory staff quickly officially recognized the Gully 30 Calcareous Fen which initiated a lengthy permitting process to authorize Enbridge to construct the LSr and Alberta Clipper Pipelines through the Gully 30 Calcareous Fen. Avoiding the fen would have involved an impracticable reroute along several miles of greenfield. The state (DNR) and federal (Army Corps of Engineers) process involved detailed characterization of the resource, development and approval of an alternatives analysis according to Section 404(b)(1) guidelines, and drafting and approval of a project-specific Fen Management Plan which stipulated specific construction mitigation procedures including winter construction and protective temporary drainage, and post construction monitoring requirements. This presentation introduces the calcareous fen resource and examines the permitting and iterative, comment-response construction-design process as an example of successful collaboration between state and federal agencies and Enbridge to construct a pipeline through a highly regulated, sensitive natural resource while maintaining schedule.

The impact on groundwater budget is often calculated by numerical models, such as SWAP and HYDRUS, using the Penman-Monteith-equation for potential and actual \\xc3\\xa9vapotranspiration and the Richards equation (using van Genuchten-Mualem-parameter) for water movement in the vadose zone. On the one hand, using such a detailed model has the advantage to identify seasonal shiftings in the soil water budget; on the other hand applying those models to the meso-scale has the drawback of a high data demand. To show whether an impact model is reliable enough to explain the impact of climate change on the target parameter (e.g. groundwater recharge) its sensitivity to parameter variation has to be tested. Sensitivity studies can also indicate which parameters can be neglected and which need to be investigated in more detail. Two calibrated SWAP models have been applied to estimate the impact of climate change on the water budget for an upland and a polder location. While the first site is a typical groundwater recharge area, the latter is a ditch-drained area where permanent groundwater discharge occurs. For both sites, climate projections from two regional climate models (CLM and REMO) driven by the general circulation model ECHAM5 have been used. The results from two realizations of the SRES CO 2-scenarios A1B, B1 and A2 as well as the C20 reference period were available. Instead of using the data directly, two different bias correction methods were applied: a linear bias correction method and the so-called quantile mapping method. The Cram\\xc3\\xa9r-von Mises criterion has been applied to show which method is applicable for each site. Afterwards, two sensitivity tests were conducted. The Model-Scenario-Ratio (MSR) has been applied to identify the effect of parameter uncertainty on the relative impact of climate change on the oil water budget. The Scenario-Uncertainty-Ratio (SUR), which we adapted from the MSR, identifies whether the impact of the parameter uncertainty or the climate change impact is stronger. As a result we see that different hydrological settings show different parameters to be sensitive in terms of water budget. While crop and meteorological parameters are sensitive for the upland site, soil and drainage parameters are shown to be more important for the polder site. The study shows that process-oriented model-codes can be applied to meso-scale, if an appropriate sensitivity study is carried out to identify parameters that can be neglected for regionalization.

Our results highlight homogeneous 87Sr/86Sr ratios typical of oligotrophic oceanic waters (OOW) (i.e., 0.709172 \\xc2\\xb1 0.000023) in the Pacific Tatakoto atoll and along a Mediterranean shore to offshore transect (~25 km off Banyuls-sur-Mer, BSM). This attests that oceanic inputs from oligotrophic areas remain the main Sr source in open shelf areas compared with submarine groundwater discharges (SGD) or particulate dissolution influences. In BSM, only foreshore data are more radiogenic, possibly due to rainwater mixing, local groundwater springs or more efficient particle dissolution in the intertidal zone. In restricted areas, we report variable 87Sr/86Sr ratios between the Salses-Leucate (France) and Oualidia (Morocco) lagoons. The first one has homogeneous 87Sr/86Sr ratio typical of OOW except close to SGD. In Oualidia, 87Sr/86Sr ratios decrease by 1.2 \\xc3\\x97 10\\xe2\\x88\\x923 from OOW values close to the Atlantic inlet to progressively less radiogenic ones upstream within the interior of the lagoon. These differences depend on several factors including the leaky, restricted or choked morphology of lagoons modulating the oceanic Sr inputs, but also SGD fluxes whose 87Sr/86Sr ratios and Sr concentrations are highly variable according to the nature of rocks leached in karstic aquifer. In Oualidia, the low 87Sr/86Sr ratios correspond to high Sr concentrations (up to 150 \\xce\\xbcmol\\xc2\\xb7l\\xe2\\x88\\x921) issued from the dissolution of Mesozoic evaporites, leading to SGD fluxes accounting for 60% of the local Sr budget. Through data compilation, we show that similar 87Sr/86Sr gradients and processes prevail at the whole Mediterranean scale. Finally, we postulate that high coastal water retention times can also account for anomalous coastal 87Sr/86Sr ratios and that the combination of water mass restriction, SGD, bioadsorption and early diagenetic processes could decrease seawater Sr concentrations in some marginal areas.\",\"citedby-count\":\"12\",\"authkeywords\":\"Coastal environment | Groundwater | Open shelf | Seawater | Shells | Strontium isotopes\"},{\"@_fa\": \"true\", \"prism:url\":\"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85098533091\",\"dc:title\":\"Submarine groundwater discharge alters coral reef ecosystem metabolism: SGD alters ecosystem metabolism\",\"dc:creator\":\"Silbiger N.J.\",\"prism:publicationName\":\"Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences\",\"prism:coverDate\":\"2020-12-23\",\"prism:doi\":\"10.1098/rspb.2020.2743\",\"dc:description\":\"Submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) influences near-shore coral reef ecosystems worldwide.

The driving mechanism for groundwater discharge and associated pingo formation is enigmatic because wet-based glaciers are not present in the adjacent highlands and the presence of continuous permafrost seems to preclude recharge of the sub-permafrost groundwater system by either a subglacial source or a precipitation surplus. Since the pingo springs enable methane that has accumulated underneath the permafrost to escape directly to the atmosphere, our limited understanding of the groundwater system brings significant uncertainty to predictions of how methane emissions will respond to changing climate. We address this problem with a new conceptual model for open-system pingo formation wherein pingo growth is sustained by sub-permafrost pressure effects, as related to the expansion of water upon freezing, during millennial-scale basal permafrost aggradation. We test the viability of this mechanism for generating groundwater flow with decoupled heat (one-dimensional transient) and groundwater (three-dimensional steady state) transport modelling experiments. Our results suggest that the conceptual model represents a feasible mechanism for the formation of open-system pingos in lower Adventdalen and elsewhere. We also explore the potential for additional pressurisation and find that methane production and methane clathrate formation and dissolution deserve particular attention on account of their likely effects upon the hydraulic pressure. Our model simulations also suggest that the generally low-permeability hydrogeological units cause groundwater residence times to exceed the duration of the Holocene. The likelihood of such pre-Holocene groundwater ages is supported by the geochemistry of the pingo springs which demonstrates an unexpected seaward freshening of groundwater potentially caused by a palaeo-subglacial meltwater \\\\\"wedge\\\\\"from the Weichselian. Whereas permafrost thickness (and age) progressively increases inland, accordingly, the sub-permafrost meltwater wedge thins, and less unfrozen freshwater is available for mixing. Our observations imply that millennial-scale permafrost aggradation deserves more attention as a possible driver of sustained flow of sub-permafrost groundwater and methane to the surface because, although the hydrological system in Adventdalen at first appears unusual, it is likely that similar systems have developed in other uplifted valleys throughout the Arctic.\",\"citedby-count\":\"8\"},{\"@_fa\": \"true\", \"prism:url\":\"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85098629310\",\"dc:title\":\"An integrated electrical resistivity and geochemical approach to delineate groundwater contamination due to seawater intrusion in the southern part of Mangalore, Karnataka, India\",\"dc:creator\":\"Priya K.\",\"prism:publicationName\":\"IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science\",\"prism:coverDate\":\"2020-12-17\",\"prism:doi\":\"10.1088/1755-1315/597/1/012012\",\"dc:description\":\"In this paper, integration of electrical resistivity survey and chemical analyses of groundwater has been executed in Mangalore\\'s southern part, Karnataka to delineate seawater intrusion phenomena.

The geochemical analyses show that good groundwater conditions characterize the study area except for the southern part. The southern part is under the moderate to high salinity hazard risk, possibly due to its proximity to the sea and hydraulic connection with the seawater through the tidal creek.

Instead, downslope shallow throughflow was thought to dominate, generating more than 90% of streamflow. We used a chemical hydrograph separation approach to estimate annual groundwater discharge for three catchments over periods of up to 39 years, and found that direct groundwater contributions to streamflow were far more variable across catchments and through time than has previously been acknowledged. The estimated proportion of annual streamflow sourced directly from groundwater ranged from 0 to 93% and was related linearly to the size of the groundwater discharge area in the catchment valley floor. In contrast, contributions from shallow sources including shallow throughflow varied primarily and linearly with annual rainfall. However, the response to rainfall was \\xe2\\x80\\x9camplified\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in a predictable way by the size of the groundwater discharge area, consistent with the variable source area concept.

This paper aims at introducing, in a unified format, the general class of Interior Penalty DG (IPDG) methods to solve the VDF equations. A combination of symmetric, non-symmetric and incomplete IPDG methods is used to discretize both head and concentration variables. Compatibility analysis is performed to prevent the loss of accuracy of the IPDG methods in simulations of coupled flow and transport equations. An accurate technique is used for time integration, based on a non-iterative procedure and adaptive time stepping with embedded error control. Several benchmarks are investigated to validate the proposed DG scheme and to examine its performance in simulating VDF problems. The new DG scheme reproduces better the experimental data than the conventional SEAWAT model. Its results are in excellent agreement with a recent semi-analytical solution of the Henry problem, dealing with seawater intrusion under convection-dominating conditions. The performance of the DG scheme is examined by simulating the challenging problem of natural convection in porous enclosure. The method is compared against a finite element solution obtained with COMSOL multi-physics. The numerical experiments indicate clearly that high-order DG method is much more appropriate than standard conforming Galerkin method in simulating VDF problems while at the same time, guaranteeing a better precision and high-fidelity solutions.

The study aims were as follows: (i) to characterise spatial water chemistry patterns; (ii) to establish the role played by the hyporheic zone in the chemical transformations associated with the groundwater that supplies the first-order stream; and (iii) to identify the factors that control the chemical composition transformations that occur in headwater alcoves. The analysis was performed on three sets of samples taken at the \\xc5\\xbbarnowo channel head situated in the young glacial landscape of the Pars\\xc4\\x99ta drainage basin (NW Poland). The performed hydrochemical measurements showed that the waters found in the alcoves displayed a mosaic pattern, with spatial variability in the levels of trace metals and nutrients. In turn, geogenic ions featured in the mineralogical-petrographic compositions of deposits found in headwater catchments, such as Ca2+, HCO3\\xe2\\x88\\x92, Mg2+, and Na+, showed low temporal variability and small differences among the various sampled headwater alcoves. These results indicated that the majority of spatial variance associated with the chemical composition of water is driven by the transformation of groundwater discharges in the hyporheic zone. The locations of hydrochemical transformation hotspots can be explained by the influences of critical physical variables, such as the intensity of seepage erosion, sediment texture, bottom microtopography, groundwater discharge characteristics, water temperatures, and the diversity of groundwater-fed vegetation. Hydrochemical studies performed in the ground- and surface-water contact zones within a channel head can identify the underlying causes of changes to water chemistry, which, in turn, can facilitate the protection of water resources against unfavourable changes that may affect the water quality at the headwater catchment.\",\"citedby-count\":\"4\",\"authkeywords\":\"Channel head | Groundwater\\xe2\\x80\\x93surface water interactions | Headwater stream | Hyporheic zone | Water chemistry | Young glacial landscape\"},{\"@_fa\": \"true\", \"prism:url\":\"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85089568687\",\"dc:title\":\"Carbon dioxide dynamics in a tropical estuary over seasonal and rain-event time scales\",\"dc:creator\":\"Macklin P.A.\",\"prism:publicationName\":\"Continental Shelf Research\",\"prism:coverDate\":\"2020-12-13\",\"prism:doi\":\"10.1016/j.csr.2020.104196\",\"dc:description\":\"Tropical estuaries may release large amounts of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, but remain understudied relative to temperate systems.

Improper use of these substances in combination with increasing seawater intrusion results in long-term and nonpoint soil and groundwater contamination. In this work, a 3-D groundwater and solute transport numerical model was created to simulate the effect of excessive fertilizers application along the Bahr El Baqar drain system, in the eastern Nile Delta, Egypt. The geotechnical properties of the soils, hydrologic parameters, and unconfined compressive strength were determined at different sites and used as input parameters for the model. Model results showed that silty clay soils are able to contain the contaminations and preserve the groundwater quality. Nevertheless, sandy soils primarily located at the beginning of the Bahr El Baqar drain allow leakage of fertilizers to the groundwater. Thus, fertilizer application should be properly managed in the top sandy layers to protect the groundwater and soil, as increasing aquifer by excess irrigation water increased the groundwater contamination in confined layers due to the high value of cumulative salt for the current situation while the unconfined zone decreased groundwater and soil contamination. A mass transport 3-D multi-species (MT3D) model was set to identify the optimal measure to tackle soil and groundwater contamination along the Bahr El-Baqar drain system. A potential increase of the abstraction rates in the study area has a positive impact in reducing the transfer of fertilizer contamination to groundwater while it has a negative impact for soil contamination. The scenario analysis further indicated that the installation of a drainage network decreases the groundwater and soil contamination. Both solutions are potentially effective for protection against nonpoint contamination along the Bahr El Baqar drain system. However, a more sustainable management approach of fertilizer application is needed to adequately protect the receptors located further downstream in the Nile Delta.\",\"citedby-count\":\"26\",\"authkeywords\":\"Ammonium sulfate application | Groundwater contamination | MT3D | Nile Delta | Numerical modeling | Soil contamination\"},{\"@_fa\": \"true\", \"prism:url\":\"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85117943667\",\"dc:title\":\"Hydrochemical and isotopic study of groundwater in Wadi El-Natrun, Western Desert, Egypt: Implication for salinization processes\",\"dc:creator\":\"Mashaal N.\",\"prism:publicationName\":\"Journal of African Earth Sciences\",\"prism:coverDate\":\"2020-12-01\",\"prism:doi\":\"10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2020.104011\",\"dc:description\":\"Ground-water samples were collected from 10 wells in Wadi El-Natrun, Western Desert, Egypt, over four consecutive years.

Previous measurements of elevated CH4 and H2 concentrations in ultramafic-hosted submarine springs indicate that active serpentinization occurs along mid-ocean ridge systems at seafloor pressures (\\xe2\\x88\\xbc<500 bar) and temperatures (\\xe2\\x88\\xbc<350 \\xc2\\xb0C). Serpentinites also exist at higher pressures in subduction zones; for example, during retrograde hydration of the forearc mantle wedge and during prograde deserpentinization within the subducted slab. However, many studies demonstrating the thermodynamic stability of reduced serpentinite fluids have been limited to terrestrial seafloor conditions. To investigate the redox state of serpentinite fluids at elevated pressures, phase equilibria and fluid compositions were computed for 100-700 \\xc2\\xb0C and 1-20 kbar using aqueous silica activity (aSiO2(aq)) as a governing parameter. Silica-sensitive, redox-buffering assemblages were selected to be consistent with previously proposed reactions: SiO2(aq)-fayalite-magnetite (QFM), SiO2(aq)-Fe-brucite-cronstedtite, SiO2(aq)-Fe-brucite-Fe3+-serpentine, plus the silica-free buffer Fe-brucite-magnetite. Fluid species are limited to simple, zerovalent compounds. For silica-bearing redox reactions, aSiO2(aq) is buffered by coexisting ultramafic mineral assemblages in the system MgO-SiO2-H2O. Silica activity and fO2 are directly correlated, with the most reduced fluids stabilized by the least siliceous assemblages. Silica activity and fO2 increase with pressure, but are more strongly dependent on temperature, leading to greater silica enrichment and more oxidized conditions along shallow, warm subduction paths than along steeper, colder paths. Reduced fluids with mCH4/mCO2 > 1 and fO2 below QFM are present only when serpentine is stable, and are favored along all subduction trajectories except shallow P-T paths at eclogite-grade. Values of mH2 and mCO/mCO2 depend strongly on P and T, but also on the choice of redox buffer, especially whether the Fe-serpentine component is cronstedtite or Fe3+-serpentine. Methane and H2S production are thermodynamically favored throughout the P-T range of the serpentinized forearc mantle and in other settings with similar conditions; for example, deep planetary seafloors. The model offers a generalized technique for estimating the redox state of a fluid-saturated serpentinite at elevated P and T, and yields results consistent with previous petrographic and thermodynamic analyses. High-pressure serpentinization may be an important source of reduced species that could influence prebiotic chemistry, support microbial life in the deep biosphere or in deep planetary oceans, or promote greenhouse warming on early Earth.\",\"citedby-count\":\"13\",\"authkeywords\":\"abiotic methane | forearc mantle wedge | serpentinization | silica activity | thermodynamic modeling\"},{\"@_fa\": \"true\", \"prism:url\":\"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85102060368\",\"dc:title\":\"Geocryological and Hydrogeological Conditions of the Western Part of Nordenskiold Land (Spitsbergen Archipelago)\",\"dc:creator\":\"Demidov N.E.\",\"prism:publicationName\":\"Izvestiya - Atmospheric and Ocean Physics\",\"prism:coverDate\":\"2020-12-01\",\"prism:doi\":\"10.1134/S000143382011002X\",\"dc:description\":\"Abstract: This work summarizes the archived data of geocryological and hydrogeological conditions in the west of Nordenskiold Land on the Spitsbergen Archipelago.

The multiscale drought evaluation Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) reveals evolving and severe drought from North Africa and the Sinai desert toward the Middle East. While there has been a period without drought between 1970 and 1990, the severity and frequency of drought increased considerably after 1990. Current drought conditions in the Eastern Mediterranean region of MENA are moderate to severe with a 60\\xe2\\x80\\x93100% likelihood of occurrence, according to time parameters. The Gaza Strip is especially vulnerable to the consequences of increasing drought because it is situated in the vicinity of the Sinai Desert; therefore, a downscaled study of drought in the region is essential to implement mitigation measures for the sustainable management and planning of coastal aquifer and agricultural activities in the Gaza Strip. Considerable availability of precipitation time series from various meteorological stations helped provide a local drought study for the Gaza Strip, in accordance with the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). The stochastic time-series model of (4,0,1) (5,1,1)12 shows a robust simulator for modeling and forecasting the future trend of precipitation at the nine meteorological stations. In terms of correlation accuracy, the model achieves a correlation (r) of approximately 93\\xe2\\x80\\x9397% in the calibration range and a correlation (r) of about 92\\xe2\\x80\\x9399% in the validation range. In terms of measuring the difference between the values, the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the model results shows that the RMSE was between 7\\xe2\\x80\\x9321 in the calibration range and 11\\xe2\\x80\\x9321 in the validation range. The model reveals a slightly stable trend in precipitation patterns at the northern meteorological stations of Beit Hanon, Beit Lahia, Shati, and Remal. However, declining precipitation tendency was recorded at the southern meteorological stations of Mughraka, Nussirat, Beir Al-Balah, Khanyounis, and Rafah. The SPI-based drought assessment implies that the precipitation annual threshold levels at SPI = 0 drop territorially from 474 mm in the north to about 250 mm in the south of the Gaza Strip. In this study, a representative 12-month local scale SPI12 at an annual precipitation threshold level of 370 mm was formulated to address the drought conditions in the Gaza Strip. Standing on the outputs of the local SPI12 scale might signify that the region of the Gaza Strip risks drought status with an incidence likelihood varying from 8% in the north to 100% in the south. Regular drought is prevalent in the northern governorates, but the hazards of extreme and severe drought are high in the southern areas with an incidence risk of about 83%. Sequentially, southern governorates of Rafah and Khanyounis experience chronic annual drought, while the return period of drought is reported to be every 9\\xe2\\x80\\x9312 years in the northern governorates of the Gaza Strip. The rain-fed years of 1998 and 2010 reported the worst periods of drought, while the period of 2016 showed a good droughtless water balance.

The hydro-geochemical characteristics of the GW change inconsistently with the addition of unwanted inorganic trace elements into the GW aquifer of the Indo-Bangladesh delta region (IBDR), such as arsenic (As) along with fluoride (F\\xe2\\x88\\x92) contamination. Contaminated GW can have a negative impact on drinking water supplies and agricultural output. GW pollution can have serious adverse effects on the environment and human health. Thus, the GW quality of this region is deteriorating progressively, and human health threatening by various life-threatening disorders. Hence, the current study concentrated on the GW quality evaluation and prediction of possible health issues in the IBDR due to elevated contamination of As along with F\\xe2\\x88\\x92 within GW aquifers by considering sixteen causative.

However, the natural background levels of chemical components in eastern Siberian rivers from permafrost-dominated regions and their responses to climate warming have not been adequately quantified. This study aims to address this knowledge gap by using a comprehensive river water chemistry database (n = 1264) spanning from 1940 to 2019. Our results reveal that the concentration of total dissolved solids (TDS), a key parameter of drinking water quality, in river basins predominantly free of permafrost (194.6 \\xc2\\xb1 256.4 mg/L) is approximately 2.3 times higher than in permafrost-dominated river basins (83.7 \\xc2\\xb1 35.8 mg/L) in eastern Siberia. These observations imply potential shifts in freshwater quality resulting from permafrost degradation. We further detect that carbonate weathering, which plays a fundamental role in the global carbon cycle, is a predominant process controlling hydrogeochemical cycles. (Ca2+ + Mg2+) concentrations as a proxy for carbonate weathering intensity are sensitive to climate warming, increasing at a rate of 0.10 mmol/(L\\xc2\\xb7\\xc2\\xb0C). This finding provides evidence that the current acceleration of carbonate weathering, driven by climate warming, is already influencing local water quality. Additionally, (Ca2+ + Mg2+) concentrations and TDS are highly interrelated with temperature-dependent variables (e.g., active layer thickness of permafrost and leaf area index) and basin erosion-controlling factors (e.g., precipitation, elevation and slope of basin). Under a warming climate, river chemical fluxes (e.g., export of TDS and major ions) increase notably, especially during the winter, indicating an increase in mineral-laden groundwater discharge to rivers due to permafrost degradation. Our results demonstrate that climate warming is accelerating hydrogeochemical processes in permafrost-dominated Arctic basins.\",\"citedby-count\":\"1\",\"authkeywords\":\"Chemical weathering | Climate warming | Eastern Siberian rivers | Permafrost degradation\"},{\"@_fa\": \"true\", \"prism:url\":\"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85172380725\",\"dc:title\":\"Spatiotemporal-aware machine learning approaches for dissolved oxygen prediction in coastal waters\",\"dc:creator\":\"Liang W.\",\"prism:publicationName\":\"Science of the Total Environment\",\"prism:coverDate\":\"2023-12-20\",\"prism:doi\":\"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.167138\",\"dc:description\":\"Coastal waters face increasing threats from hypoxia, which can have severe consequences for marine life and fisheries. This study aims to develop a machine learning approach for hypoxia monitoring by investigating the effectiveness of four tree-based models, considering spatiotemporal effects in model prediction, and adopting the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) approach for model interpretability, using the long-term climate and marine monitoring dataset in Tolo Harbour (Zone 1) and Mirs Bay (Zone 2), Hong Kong. The LightBoost model was found to be the most effective for predicting dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations using spatiotemporal datasets. Considering spatiotemporal effects improved the model\\'s bottom DO prediction performance (R2 increase 0.30 in Zone1 and 0.68 in Zone 2), although the contributions from temporal and spatial factors varied depending on the complexity of physical and chemical processes. This study focused not only on error estimates but also on model interpretation. Using SHAP, we propose that hypoxia is largely influenced by hydrodynamics, but anthropogenic activities can increase the bias of systems, exacerbating chemical reactions and impacting DO levels. Additionally, the high relative importance of silicate (Zone 1:0.11 and Zone 2: 0.19) in the model suggests that terrestrial sources, particularly submarine groundwater discharge, are important factors influencing coastal hypoxia. This is the first machine learning effort to consider spatiotemporal effects in four dimensions to predict DO concentrations, and we believe it contributes to the development of a forecasting tool for alarming hypoxia, combining real-time data and machine learning models in the near future.\",\"citedby-count\":\"0\",\"authkeywords\":\"Dissolved oxygen | Hypoxia | Machine learning | Prediction | Spatiotemporal factors\"},{\"@_fa\": \"true\", \"prism:url\":\"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85171322061\",\"dc:title\":\"Salinity origin in the coastal aquifer of the Southern Venice lowland\",\"dc:creator\":\"Alessandrino L.\",\"prism:publicationName\":\"Science of the Total Environment\",\"prism:coverDate\":\"2023-12-20\",\"prism:doi\":\"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.167058\",\"dc:description\":\"Groundwater salinization can be natural and anthropogenic in origin, although it often results from a combination of both, especially in low-lying coastal regions that are hydraulically controlled.

Research on microplastic pollution in groundwater on islands is scarce. This study is the first to explore microplastic pollution in the groundwater under a bedrock island (Dawanshan Island) located in the South China Sea. The influence of hydrogeological factors on the distribution, source, and ageing features of microplastics in the groundwater were investigated. Despite the small scale of industrial and agricultural activities on the island, the amount of microplastics in the groundwater ranged from 34 to 64 particles/L, with over 80% of the microplastics being polyester fibres with diameters smaller than 2 mm, which is comparable to those in coastal cities. These microplastics were originated from inland plastic usage, rather than from the surrounding sea, which was confirmed by the lack of seawater intrusion on the island. Owing to the low permeability of granite, microplastics were mainly distributed in the water of the loose layer of porous sediment, and their quantity decreased with depth. In addition, the abundance of microplastics in pore groundwater increased with an increase in the velocity of groundwater flow. The severity of microplastic pollution in the groundwater increased with an increase and decrease in the content of total dissolved solids and dissolved oxygen, respectively. The microplastics originated from plastic waste disposed of on the island, rather than from seawater intrusion. Also, through groundwater infiltration into exposed soil at recharge areas, artificial wells at residential areas, and water exchange with surface water at valley areas. Microplastics buried in the groundwater aged faster along the migration path of the groundwater. These microplastics threaten the safety of people and plants on the island through exposure resulting from the extraction of groundwater for irrigation, while they endanger marine life through submarine groundwater discharge.\",\"citedby-count\":\"0\",\"authkeywords\":\"bedrock island | groundwater | Hydrogeological condition | microplastic pollution\"},{\"@_fa\": \"true\", \"prism:url\":\"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85168410747\",\"dc:title\":\"Improving nitrate load simulation of the SWAT model in an extensively tile-drained watershed\",\"dc:creator\":\"Kim J.J.\",\"prism:publicationName\":\"Science of the Total Environment\",\"prism:coverDate\":\"2023-12-15\",\"prism:doi\":\"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.166331\",\"dc:description\":\"Subsurface drainage systems are effective management practices employed to remove excess soil water, thereby improving soil aeration and crop productivity. However, these systems can also contribute to water quality issues by enhancing nitrate leaching and loads from agricultural fields. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is commonly used to assess nitrate loads and long-term water quality impacts from agricultural watersheds. However, the current SWAT model oversimplifies nitrate transport processes by assuming a linear relationship between nitrate concentrations in tile flow and soil nitrate content. It also neglects the time lag between nitrate loading and transport with the flow. This study aimed to enhance the accuracy of nitrate load prediction by revising the subsurface drainage routine in the SWAT model. The revised routine was tested using flow and nitrate load measurements from a typical tile-drained watershed in east-central Illinois, U.S. The results demonstrated that the revised SWAT nitrate routine outperformed the current one in simulating nitrate transport at field and watershed scales. The revised routine improved the nitrate load prediction from an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunacceptable\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to a \\xe2\\x80\\x9csatisfactory\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgood\\xe2\\x80\\x9d rating on the field scale. A sensitivity analysis conducted using the revised nitrate module showed the parameters directly associated with transpiration, groundwater discharge to the reach, the lag time of tile flow, and channel flow hydraulics were the most sensitive in nitrate load simulation. In addition, different tile depth scenarios were modeled to evaluate variation in the amount of surface runoff, tile flow, and nitrate loads by the surface flow and tile flow. The results of tile configuration scenarios agreed with understanding the tile flow process. The test results demonstrated the potential of the revised SWAT nitrate module as a tool to accurately evaluate the effects of tile drainage systems on water quality.\",\"citedby-count\":\"0\",\"authkeywords\":\"Calibration | Nitrate | Sensitivity analysis | SWAT | Tile drainage\"},{\"@_fa\": \"true\", \"prism:url\":\"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85175257480\",\"dc:title\":\"Assessing vulnerability of coastal aquifer to seawater intrusion using Convolutional Neural Network\",\"dc:creator\":\"Nadiri A.A.\",\"prism:publicationName\":\"Marine Pollution Bulletin\",\"prism:coverDate\":\"2023-12-01\",\"prism:doi\":\"10.1016/j.marpolbul.2023.115669\",\"dc:description\":\"This study examined coastal aquifer vulnerability to seawater intrusion (SWI) in the Shiramin area in northwest Iran.

Moreover, a modified traditional GALDIT framework (mod-TGF) was prepared by eliminating the data layer of aquifer type from the GALDIT model and adding the data layers of aquifer media and well density. To the best of our knowledge, there is a research gap to improve the TGF using deep learning algorithms.

Results showed elevated levels of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) in pore water, primarily from particulate organic matter (POM) degradation that originated from decayed vascular plants. POM-to-DOM degradations further resulted in the accumulation of ammonium (NH4+) and highly unsaturated compounds in all treatments. The addition of high-ionic-strength treatments (e.g., seawater and sodium chloride [NaCl] solution) reduced DOC solubility and selectively removed dissolved aromatic compounds in porewater. The cation-rich seawater shifted the porewater NH4+ generation pathway from predominantly biological (re)mineralization in freshwater to abiotic (desorption via ion exchange) pathways in the saline water setup.

A commonly-practiced simplifying assumption in groundwater models states that incorporating extensive real-world detail does not correlate to better model results. This study discusses how this assumption may lead to unrepresentative models due to oversimplification. Sometimes, when determining the appropriate complexity of regional models, important elements of the conceptual model may be oversimplified, resulting in a nonrepresentative model or part of a model. This study tests the hypothesis that, by incorporating specific areas of greater hydrogeologic complexity into modeling a regional-sized unconfined aquifer, simulated heads will significantly better match observed conditions, especially in areas where unconfined groundwater discharges through aquitard breaches and where dry cells are a natural (realistic) condition of the system. Three surface processes (additional recharge, stream density, and evapotranspiration) were tested in multiple sets of impact models. Model outcomes were compared against observed conditions of the shallow unconfined aquifer beneath Memphis, TN, US, and against the parent fully calibrated groundwater model of the aquifer systems beneath Shelby County, TN. Results indicate that an increase in stream detail better mimics observed water table undulations. These undulations occur at the same scale as aquitard breaches and improve appropriate gradients and flow surrounding the breaches. Results further indicate that the addition of greater hydrogeologic complexity to the shallow unconfined aquifer improves models like that of Shelby County, TN, by better representing realistic gradients, conveying appropriate quantities of water through breaches, and offering an opportunity for improved contaminant transport modeling from the shallow unconfined aquifer to the deeper semiconfined Memphis aquifer via aquitard breaches.\",\"citedby-count\":\"0\"},{\"@_fa\": \"true\", \"prism:url\":\"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85173010207\",\"dc:title\":\"Deterministic factors modulating assembly of groundwater microbial community in a nitrogen-contaminated and hydraulically-connected river-lake-floodplain ecosystem\",\"dc:creator\":\"Qiao Z.\",\"prism:publicationName\":\"Journal of Environmental Management\",\"prism:coverDate\":\"2023-12-01\",\"prism:doi\":\"10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.119210\",\"dc:description\":\"The river-lake-floodplain system (RLFS) undergoes intensive surface-groundwater mass and energy exchanges.

This study tests and proposes a hybrid evaluation approach to determine Groundwater Quality Indices (GQIs) for irrigation (IRRI), seawater intrusion (SWI), and potability (POT), finalized to the spatial distribution of groundwater suitability involving water quality indicator along with hydrogeological and socio-economic factors. Mean Decrease Accuracy (MDA) and Information Gain Ratio (IGR) were used to state the importance of chosen factors such as level of groundwater above the sea, thickness of the aquifer, land cover, distance from coastline, silt soil content, recharge, distance from river and lagoons, depth to water table from ground, distance from agricultural wells, hydraulic conductivity, and lithology for each quality index, separately. The results of both methods showed that recharge is the most important parameter for GQIIRRI and GQIPOT, while the distance from the coastline and the rivers, are the most important for GQISWI. The spatial modelling of GQIIRRI and GQIPOT in the study area has been achieved applying three machine learning (ML) algorithms: the Boosted Regression Tree (BRT), the Random Forest (RF), and the Support Vector Machine (SVM). Validation results showed that RF has the highest prediction for GQIIRRI, while the SVM model has the highest prediction for the GQIPOT index. It is worth to mention that the future utilization and testing of new algorithms could produce even better results. Finally, GQIIRRI and GQIPOT were combined and compared using two combine and overlay methods to prepare a hybrid map of multi-GQIs.

However, such models have disadvantages, such as complex code modifications and new tunings, and are computationally expensive. Therefore, their application on large spatial scales is limited. A newly developed model, SWAT+gwflow integrates the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT+) with the groundwater module gwflow and has the potential to overcome these limitations. However, this coupled model has not yet been evaluated at a regional scale; hence, we present the evaluation of this model for regional studies using a global aquifer data over the seven watersheds in the Scheldt basin. Furthermore, we have investigated and quantified water balance components within the basin, with a focus on groundwater-surface water exchange. New Hydrological Insights for the Region: From the results (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of 0.8\\xe2\\x80\\x930.9 for all catchments based on monthly average streamflow during calibration and validation periods), we consider the model to be a good simulator of hydrology in the basin. In addition, the simulated groundwater head shows good agreement with observed well data (with a mean absolute error of less than 0.42 m). Also, the rivers in five of the seven watersheds are found to be strongly dependent on groundwater discharge to the streams. We conclude that (1) the SWAT+gwflow model is capable of accurately modeling hydrological processes and state variables in the seven watersheds using global aquifer data and limited computational time, (2) the climate-gridded dataset can successfully be used for (geo)hydrological studies, and (3) the groundwater-surface water interaction increases over the years (from 1975 to 2021) with a strong increment found in the Grote Nete (3.7 fold) and upper Scheldt (2.3 fold) watersheds. These results are, moreover, promising for data-scarce regions where geohydrological modeling relies on the use of global datasets, but the mere success of this modeling application does not guarantee the accuracy of the dataset for other locations, hence, further verification is required.

These environments, also known as subterranean estuaries, support an abundance of endemic macro and microorganisms. There is now growing interest in characterising the metabolisms of anchialine microbial communities, which is essential for understanding how complex ecosystems are supported in extreme environments, and assessing their vulnerability to environmental change. However, the diversity of metabolic strategies that are utilised in anchialine ecosystems remains poorly understood. Results: Here, we employ shotgun metagenomics to elucidate the key microorganisms and their dominant metabolisms along a physicochemical profile in Bundera Sinkhole, the only known continental subterranean estuary in the Southern Hemisphere. Genome-resolved metagenomics suggests that the communities are largely represented by novel taxonomic lineages, with 75% of metagenome-assembled genomes assigned to entirely new or uncharacterised families. These diverse and novel taxa displayed depth-dependent metabolisms, reflecting distinct phases along dissolved oxygen and salinity gradients. In particular, the communities appear to drive nutrient feedback loops involving nitrification, nitrate ammonification, and sulphate cycling. Genomic analysis of the most highly abundant members in this system suggests that an important source of chemotrophic energy is generated via the metabolic coupling of nitrogen and sulphur cycling. Conclusion: These findings substantially contribute to our understanding of the novel and specialised microbial communities in anchialine ecosystems, and highlight key chemosynthetic pathways that appear to be important in these energy-limited environments.

These findings suggest that reductions in SGD via climate change decreases in rainfall or increased water-use from the aquifer may relax physiological constraints on H. musciformis. Collectively, this study reveals divergent physiologies of a native and an invasive macroalga to SGD and highlights the importance of maintaining SGD quantity and quality to protect nearshore GDEs.\",\"citedby-count\":\"0\"},{\"@_fa\": \"true\", \"prism:url\":\"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85167616822\",\"dc:title\":\"Climate change impacts on groundwater discharge-dependent streamflow in an alpine headwater catchment\",\"dc:creator\":\"Halloran L.J.S.\",\"prism:publicationName\":\"Science of the Total Environment\",\"prism:coverDate\":\"2023-12-01\",\"prism:doi\":\"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.166009\",\"dc:description\":\"Climate change will have\\xe2\\x80\\x94and, in much of the world, is already having\\xe2\\x80\\x94a pronounced impact on alpine water resources. A deeper understanding of the future role of groundwater in alpine catchments, including quantification of climate change impacts on groundwater discharge, is vital for understanding the future of alpine water resources as a whole. Here, we develop and couple a geophysics-informed groundwater model with a net recharge model to investigate the impacts of climate change on a nival-regime alpine headwater catchment with significant unconfined Quaternary aquifer coverage. Flow in the groundwater-fed stream at the catchment outlet is analysed to determine changes in its annual dynamics. Comparing the periods 2020\\xe2\\x80\\x932040 and 2080\\xe2\\x80\\x932100 under ten RCP-8.5 climate models, we find a 35 % decrease in mean groundwater discharge and an increase in no-flow periods from ~0 % to 4.3 %. We also observe significant changes to the timing of monthly mean discharge maxima and minima, which shift ~1 month and ~5 months earlier, respectively. While groundwater has the potential to dampen the impacts of snow cover loss, currently perennial nival-regime alpine streams could be at risk of becoming intermittent by the end of the century. Our study underscores the increasingly critical role that groundwater will play in alpine catchments and emphasizes the need for quantitative understanding of the limits to its buffering capacity.\",\"citedby-count\":\"0\",\"authkeywords\":\"Alpine hydrology | Climate change | Electrical resistivity tomography | European Alps | Groundwater | Streamflow\"},{\"@_fa\": \"true\", \"prism:url\":\"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85164403067\",\"dc:title\":\"Hellenic karst waters: geogenic and anthropogenic processes affecting their geochemistry and quality\",\"dc:creator\":\"Li Vigni L.\",\"prism:publicationName\":\"Scientific Reports\",\"prism:coverDate\":\"2023-12-01\",\"prism:doi\":\"10.1038/s41598-023-38349-6\",\"dc:description\":\"Karst hydrosystems represent one of the largest global drinking water resources, but they are extremely vulnerable to pollution. Climate change, high population density, intensive industrial, and agricultural activities are the principal causes of deterioration, both in terms of quality and quantity, of these resources. Samples from 172 natural karst springs were collected in the whole territory of Greece. To identify any geogenic contamination and/or anthropogenic pollution, analyses of their chemical compositions, in terms of major ions and trace elements, were performed and compared to the EU limits for drinking water. Based on chloride content, the collected karst springs were divided into two groups: low-chloride (< 100\\xc2\\xa0mg L\\xe2\\x88\\x921) and high-chloride content (> 100\\xc2\\xa0mg L\\xe2\\x88\\x921). An additional group of springs with calcium-sulfate composition was recognised. Nitrate concentrations were always below the EU limit (50\\xc2\\xa0mg L\\xe2\\x88\\x921), although some springs presented elevated concentrations. High contents in terms of trace elements, such as B, Sr, As, and Pb, sometimes exceeding the limits, were rarely found. The Greek karst waters can still be considered a good quality resource both for human consumption and for agriculture. The main issues derive from seawater intrusion in the aquifers along the coasts. Moreover, the main anthropogenic pollutant is nitrate, found in higher concentrations mostly in the same coastal areas where human activities are concentrated. Finally, high levels of potentially harmful trace elements (e.g. As, Se) are very limited and of natural origin (geothermal activity, ore deposits, etc.).\",\"citedby-count\":\"0\"}]}}'\n","Total results: 2112\n","            Author                                              Title  Year  \\\n","0       Uddin M.H.
