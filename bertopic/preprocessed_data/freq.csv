The basis of effective water management is an understanding of the water cycle process. This study investigated the surface water-groundwater origins and connectivity using stable isotopes (δD and δ18O) of surface water and groundwater in 11 river basins in the Ordos Basin. It was found that the surface water-groundwater origins and hydraulic connection were characterized by regional differences, mainly induced by climatic characteristics, hydrogeological conditions and human activities. Specifically, the impact of thick loess deposits caused surface water and groundwater to take long time to produce a hydraulic connection. In contrast, areas with thin loess deposits and frequent human activities showed a good connectivity between surface water and groundwater. As for water origins, summer precipitation was a common source of surface water and groundwater in the study area, and groundwater discharge was another source of surface water. However, surface water and groundwater were subjected to different degrees of evaporation during receiving precipitation recharge. Notably, thick loess deposits had an impact on groundwater evaporation because both the recharge of precipitation to groundwater and the discharge of groundwater to surface water took a long time. In addition, it was found that frequent human activities (mining, irrigation and urban construction) could weaken the impact of evaporation. This large-scale analysis provided new insights into the origins and connectivity of surface water and groundwater in areas with thick unsaturated zones for water resources management.', 'Development of the coastal aquifer systems of Southern California has resulted in overdraft, changes in streamflow, seawater intrusion, land subsidence, increased vertical flow between aquifers, and a redirection of regional flow toward pumping centers. These water-management challenges can be more effectively addressed by incorporating new understanding of the geologic, hydrologic, and geochemical setting of these aquifers. Groundwater and surface-water flow are controlled, in part, by the geologic setting. The physiographic province and related tectonic fabric control the relation between the direction of geomorphic features and the flow of water. Geologic structures such as faults and folding also control the direction of flow and connectivity of groundwater flow. The layering of sediments and their structural association can also influence pathways of groundwater flow and seawater intrusion. Submarine canyons control the shortest potential flow paths that can result in seawater intrusion. The location and extent of offshore outcrops can also affect the flow of groundwater and the potential for seawater intrusion and land subsidence in coastal aquifer systems. As coastal aquifer systems are developed, the source and movement of groundwater and surface-water resources change. In particular, groundwater flow is affected by the relative contributions of different types of inflows and outflows, such as pumpage from multi-aquifer wells within basal or upper coarse-grained units, streamflow infiltration, and artificial recharge. These natural and anthropogenic inflows and outflows represent the supply and demand components of the water budgets of groundwater within coastal watersheds. They are all significantly controlled by climate variability related to major climate cycles, such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. The combination of natural forcings and anthropogenic stresses redirects the flow of groundwater and either mitigates or exacerbates the potential adverse effects of resource development, such as declining water levels, seawater intrusion, land subsidence, and mixing of different waters. Streamflow also has been affected by development of coastal aquifer systems and related conjunctive use. Saline water is the largest water-quality problem in Southern California coastal aquifer systems. Seawater intrusion is a significant source of saline water, but saline water is also known to come from other sources and processes. Seawater intrusion is typically restricted to the coarse-grained units at the base of fining-upward sequences of terrestrial deposits, and at the top of coarsening upward sequences of marine deposits. This results in layered and narrow intrusion fronts. Maintaining the sustainability of Southern California coastal aquifers requires joint management of surface water and groundwater (conjunctive use). This requires new data collection and analyses (including research drilling, modern geohydrologic investigations, and development of detailed computer groundwater models that simulate the supply and demand components separately), implementation of new facilities (including spreading and injection facilities for artificial recharge), and establishment of new institutions and policies that help to sustain the water resources and better manage regional development. © 2009 Geological Society of America.', 'Groundwater and surface water are hydraulically connected in many landscapes, and a better understanding of their connectivity is critical for effective management of water resources. Environmental tracers are a useful preliminary tool to study the interaction between groundwater and surface water and provide independent means for corroborating or refuting information based on more traditional investigations. This paper discusses the results of using major ions, stable isotopes (deuterium and oxygen-18) and a radioactive isotope (radon-222) as environmental tracers to better understand groundwater-surface water interactions in the Border Rivers catchment, Australia. In the upstream reaches of the catchment, shallow groundwater close to the river has a similar major-ion and stable-isotope chemistry to that of the river water, and is different to the groundwater distant from the river. The near-stream groundwater has an enriched isotopic signature (less negative) whereas groundwater far from the river has a depleted isotopic signature. Overall, the comparison of chloride concentrations with deuterium suggests that three types of groundwater occur in the Border Rivers catchment: (i) the near-stream groundwaters influenced by direct recharge from the river; (ii) the groundwaters marginal to the river that are more influenced by diffuse rainfall recharge; and (iii) saline groundwaters in the downstream part of the catchment which never (or rarely) receive recharge from surface water. River water samples obtained during the high-flow season show a very low variation in radon concentrations (0.11-0.39 Bq/L). The longitudinal transect of radon concentration measurements in river water during the high-flow season indicates that there is no groundwater contribution to stream flow. Radon concentrations are lower in groundwater close to the rivers and increase with distance from the river, in general coincidence with the salinity and chloride concentration. This indicates river water infiltration into nearby alluvial aquifers, rather than groundwater discharge to the river. The results of hydrochemical and environmental isotope sampling indicate that in the upper catchment area (upstream of Keetah) the river is connected to and actively recharges the near-stream shallow alluvial aquifer. Using the environmental isotope data, we have also demonstrated that recharge of the alluvial aquifers by surface water occurs by bank infiltration, with diffuse recharge during high-rainfall events more dominant further away from the river. This information would be useful for a better understanding of the nature and extent of hydrogeological processes at the river-aquifer interface and their links with biogeochemical processes and ultimately water allocation policies.']"

In the study area, groundwater samples are mostly characterized by a Ca-HCO3 facies, indicating that the groundwater hydrogeochemical evolution is mainly controlled by the carbonate mineral dissolution/precipitation. The cationic and anionic concentrations confirm that groundwater samples belong to the order of Ca2+ > Mg2+ > Na+ > K+ and HCO3− > Cl− > SO42−, respectively. Well water samples show, over time, an increasing mineralization with respect to the spring water samples. In more detail, the enrichment of Ca2+, Na+, and Cl- in well water samples is mainly due to the dissolution of calcite, dolomite, and halite minerals and secondly to a probable ion exchange related to seawater intrusion. Seawater intrusion, probably affecting the chemical composition of well water samples, was studied using ionic ratios, graphical approaches, and specific indices, such as the BEX index. Results suggest that carbonate weathering, ion exchange, and seawater intrusion in this karst coastal region are the major factors controlling groundwater geochemistry. This study shows that groundwater quality assessment, based on hydrogeochemical investigation techniques, has been a useful tool to characterize and model carbonate aquifers in Central Italy, with the aim of achieving proper management and protection of these important water resources.', 'The estuary-bay system is a common and complex coastal environment. However, quantifying submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) and associated nutrient fluxes in the complex coastal environment is challenging due to more dynamic and complicated riverine discharge, ocean processes and human activities. In this study, SGD and SFGD (submarine fresh groundwater discharge) fluxes were evaluated by combining stable and radium isotopes in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area (GBA), a typical estuary-bay system. We first built a spatially distributed radium mass balance model to quantify SGD fluxes in coastal areas of GBA integrating the Pearl River Estuary (PRE), bays and shelf. We then used the stable water isotope (δ2H and δ18O) end-member mixing model to distinguish submarine fresh groundwater discharge (SFGD) from SGD. Based on the 228Ra mass balance, the estimated SGD fluxes in the PRE, adjacent bay, and shelf areas were (6.14 ± 2.74) × 108 m3 d-1, (3.00 ± 1.11) × 107 m3 d-1, and (5.00 ± 5.64) × 108 m3 d-1, respectively. Results showed that the largest area-averaged SGD was in the PRE, followed by that in the adjacent shelf and the bay. These differences may be mainly influenced by ocean forces, urbanization and benthic topographies controlling the variability of groundwater pathways. Further, the three end-member mixing model of 228Ra and salinity was developed to confirm the validity of the estimated SGD using the Ra mass balance model. In the two models, groundwater end-member and water apparent age estimation were the main sources of uncertainty in SGD. The estimated SFGD flux was (1.39 ± 0.76) × 108 m3 d-1, which accounted for approximately 12% of the total SGD. Combining stable and radium isotopes was a useful method to estimate groundwater discharge. Moreover, the estimated SGD associated dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) flux was one order of magnitude higher than other DIN sources. SGD was considered to be a significant contributor to the DIN loading to the GBA. The findings of this study are expected to provide valuable information on coastal groundwater management and environmental protection of the GBA and similar coastal areas elsewhere.', 'It has been reported that about 47% of groundwater wells within 10 km from the coastline in the western/southern coastal areas of Korea were affected by seawater. It has been interpreted that the cause of groundwater salinization is seawater intrusion. The Gilsan stream in the Seocheon area was a tidal stream until the Geumgang estuary dam was constructed and operated. Therefore, it is likely that the Gilsan stream catchment was deposited with sediments containing high-saline formation water prior to the use of landfill farmland at this catchment area. The groundwater in this study area showed EC values ranging from 111 to 21,000 µS/cm, and the water quality types were diverse including Ca(or Na)-HCO3, Ca(or Na)-HCO3(Cl), Na-Cl(HCO3), Na-Cl types. It is believed that this diversity of water quality is due to the mixing of seawater and fresh groundwater generated by infiltration of precipitation and surface water through soil and weathered part. In this study, we discussed whether this water quality diversity and the presence of saline groundwater are due to present seawater intrusion or to remnant high-saline pore water in sediments during flushing out process. For this, rain water, surface water, seawater, and groundwater were compared regarding the water quality characteristics, tritium content, oxygen/hydrogen stable isotopic composition, and 87Sr/86Sr ratio. The oxygen/hydrogen stable isotopic compositions indicated that water composition of saline groundwaters with large EC values are composed of a mixture of those of fresh groundwater and surface water. Also, the young groundwater estimated by tritium content has generally higher NO3 content. All these characteristics showed that fresh groundwater and surface water have continued to affect the high-saline groundwater quality in the study area. In addition, considering the deviation pattern in the diagrams of Na/Cl ratio versus Cl content and SAR (sodium adsorption ratio) versus Cl content, in which two end members of fresh surface-ground water and seawater are assumed, it is interpreted that the groundwater in the study area is not experiencing present seawater intrusion, but flush out and retreating from ancient saline formation water.']"

In this study, the groundwater flow and solute transport in a coastal aquifer of Minjur in India were simulated considering the possible cases of aquifer recharge, freshwater draft, relocation of pumping wells, etc., using numerical modelling software. The groundwater flow model MODFLOW and solute transport model MT3D were calibrated for seven years period and validated against the dataset for two years, which gave satisfactory results. The sensitivity analysis of model parameters revealed that the horizontal hydraulic conductivity greatly influenced the hydraulic head. The model was used to predict the response of the coastal aquifer to four potential scenarios like aquifer recharge, reduced pumping, relocation of pumping wells, and a combination of these scenarios. The effectiveness of various management scenarios was evaluated based on their ability to improve groundwater level and salinity in observation wells/piezometers, reduce the affected area and restrict the advancement of the seawater-freshwater interface. The result of predictive simulation indicated that a combination of scenarios such as reduction in groundwater pumping by 25% from the semi-confined aquifer, increased pumping by 25% from the unconfined aquifer, and increased recharge from rivers by constructing check dams have the potential to restrict the seawater-freshwater interface movement and improve groundwater quality in Minjur aquifer. These control measures would effectively shift the interface towards the coast by 1.0 km in the unconfined aquifer and 1.5 km in the semi-confined aquifer by 2025.', 'The dynamic behavior of groundwater flow and salt transport is affected by tide and pumping in coastal multilayered aquifers. In this paper, two groups of experiments were conducted considering different constant head inland boundaries. The fluctuation of the groundwater level and the process of seawater intrusion in the multilayered aquifers were observed. A two-dimensional SEAWAT model is developed to simulate the seawater intrusion to coastal aquifers under the influences of tidal fluctuation and groundwater exploitation. The hydrogeological parameters in the model are calibrated by the records of the groundwater level and salinity measurements. The results showed that the simulated groundwater level and salt concentration match the observation well. The groundwater level has the characteristics of periodic fluctuation with tide. The lag time of the groundwater level fluctuation in each monitoring point increases slightly with the increasing distance from the saltwater chamber. For the low tide, the inland freshwater recharge has main effect on groundwater level fluctuation. The rising tide has a negative effect on the drawdown of the groundwater level induced by pumping. For the high tide, the tide plays a major role on groundwater level fluctuation, compared with the inland freshwater recharge. Compared with the condition of high head of inland recharge, larger saltwater intrusion lengths and area have been observed and simulated in the aquifer, which means that faster inland motion of the seawater wedge would occur when the inland recharge is small in the coastal aquifers. It revealed that inland recharge plays a major role in the seawater intrusion for the same pumping rate of groundwater in different seasons. The analysis provides insights into how the tide fluctuation, groundwater pumping, and inland recharge effect on the area and rates of seawater intrusion.', 'Seawater intrusion is considered as one of the main processes that degrade water quality by raising salinity to levels exceeding acceptable drinking water standards. Over-abstraction is the main cause of seawater intrusion. Moreover, climate change and sea level rise speed up seawater intrusion. This paper presents the development of a coupled transient finite element model for simulation of fluid flow and solute transport in soils and its application to study seawater intrusion in Gaza aquifer. The effects of likely sea level rise due to climate change and over-pumping on seawater intrusion in Gaza aquifer are studied using three scenarios: rise in sea level due to climate change; decrease in piezometric head on the land side due to over-pumping; and a combination of sea level rise and overpumping. The results show that a rise of 1 m in sea level has a significant effect on the position of the transition zone and can result in a further 0.5 km seawater intrusion in Gaza aquifer. However, the combination of sea level rise and over-pumping results in movement of the transition zone further inland (nearly 1.0 km). The results show that Gaza aquifer is subjected to severe seawater intrusion from the Mediterranean Sea and there is an urgent need to protect the aquifer from seawater intrusion.']"

Groundwater contributions to streamflow were measured along a section of stream during baseflow conditions and during rainfall events. Four techniques were used to estimate the contribution of groundwater to the stream along a 450 m reach (three during baseflow and one during stormflow conditions). Under baseflow conditions, streamflow measurements using the velocity-area technique indicated that the net groundwater flux to the stream during the summer months was ~ 10 ml s-1 m-1. Hydrometric measurements (i.e. hydraulic gradient and hydraulic conductivity) taken using mini-piezometers installed in the sediments beneath the stream resulted in net groundwater flux estimates that were four to five times lower. Seepage meters failed to provide any measurements of water flux into or out of the stream. Therefore, based on these results, the velocity-area technique gives the best estimate of groundwater discharge. Hydrograph separations were conducted using 18O/16O isotopic ratios and electrical conductivity on two large rainfall events with different antecedent moisture conditions in the catchment. Both events showed that pre-event water (generally considered groundwater) dominated streamflow and tile drain flow with 64%-80% of the total discharge contributed by pre-event water. High water table conditions within the catchment resulted in greater stream discharge and a greater contribution of event water in the streamflow than that observed under low water table conditions for similar intensity storm events. The results also showed that differences in riparian zone width, vegetation and surface saturation conditions between the upper and lower catchment can influence the relative magnitude of streamflow response from the two catchment areas.', 'The use of process-based, dynamic and spatially-explicit models to describe water and nitrogen fluxes at the catchment-scale is often hampered by a shortage of detailed land use, hydrological and biogeochemical information. Accordingly, such complex models tend to be restricted to a small number of well investigated catchments, often associated with research projects. On the other hand, stream flow and stream water chemistry time series data are available for a much larger number of catchments, e.g. for many catchments that are routinely monitored by government agencies for state-of-the-environment reporting. It was the main aim of this study to provide a spatially lumped model that allows meaningful analysis of catchment-scale water and nitrate fluxes based on such data sets.Based on stream flow time series data, catchment hydrodynamics are often analysed using approaches derived from the linearised Boussinesq equation, which has analytical solutions for dynamic groundwater discharge expressed in terms of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions (eigenmodel approach). Calibrated Boussinesq models generally yield a good reproduction of stream flow dynamics, and stable estimates for aquifer parameters such as hydraulic conductivity and mean aquifer depth. By linking a soil water balance model with two Boussinesq groundwater eigenmodels linked in series, and assuming constant solute concentrations discharging from each source, a dynamic catchment model predicting stream flow and water chemistry at the catchment outlet (""StreamGEM"") was developed. Compared with previous approaches, inclusion of water chemistry in this model both aided hydrological understanding, and allowed assessment of catchmentscale nitrate fluxes.Simultaneous calibration of the model to stream flow and nitrate concentration data from a small lowland dairying catchment yielded good predictions to both variables (Nash-Sutcliffe Model Efficiency of 0.90 and 0.84), and the fitted parameters were able to be used to estimate annual flow and nitrate fluxes through near-surface, shallow groundwater, and deeper groundwater reservoirs conceptually present in the catchment. The calibration was cross-validated using an independent time series from the same catchment.The results support the hypothesis, based on groundwater observations, that stream flow in the catchment is the result of mixed discharge from a shallower, rapidly draining zone of oxidised groundwater carrying relatively high loads of agricultural nitrate, with a relatively deeper and slower draining zone of reduced groundwater that is essentially nitrate free. The proportions of stream flow discharging from the near-surface, shallow groundwater, and deeper groundwater reservoirs were estimated to be 5%, 80% and 15%, respectively. In spite of its small contribution to total stream flow, the deeper groundwater reservoir sustained stream flow during summer and dominated stream water chemistry 61% of the time.By combining the flow and nitrate concentration estimates derived from model calibration, it was estimated that discharge of shallow groundwater was responsible for 91% of the nitrate load entering the stream. However, the predicted nitrate concentration in this reservoir was significantly lower than the predicted nitrate concentration of near-surface flow and root zone leachate concentrations estimated using a nutrient budgeting model. This indicates that denitrification occurs within this reservoir. On the basis of the calibrated model, it was estimated that 36% of the nitrate recharged from the vadose zone gets denitrified within the shallow groundwater reservoir, and up to 9% in the deeper groundwater reservoir. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.', 'Detecting, quantifying and understanding groundwater discharge to streams are crucial for the assessment of water, nutrient and contaminant exchange at the groundwater-surface water interface. In lowland agricultural catchments with significant groundwater discharge this is of particular importance because of the risk of excess leaching of nutrients to streams. Here we aim to combine hydraulic and tracer methods from point-to-catchment scale to assess the temporal and spatial variability of groundwater discharge in a lowland, groundwater gaining stream in Denmark. At the point-scale, groundwater fluxes to the stream were quantified based on vertical streambed temperature profiles (VTPs). At the reach scale (0.15-2 km), the spatial distribution of zones of focused groundwater discharge was investigated by the use of distributed temperature sensing (DTS). Groundwater discharge to the stream was quantified using differential gauging with an acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP). At the catchment scale (26-114 km2), runoff sources during main rain events were investigated by hydrograph separations based on electrical conductivity (EC) and stable isotopes 2H/1H. Clear differences in runoff sources between catchments were detected, ranging from approximately 65% event water for the most responsive sub-catchment to less than 10% event water for the least responsive sub-catchment. This was supported by the groundwater head gradients, where the location of weaker gradients correlated with a stronger response to precipitation events. This shows a large variability in groundwater discharge to the stream, despite the similar lowland characteristics of sub-catchments indicating the usefulness of environmental tracers for obtaining information about integrated catchment functioning during precipitation events. There were also clear spatial patterns of focused groundwater discharge detected by the DTS and ADCP measurements at the reach scale indicating high spatial variability, where a significant part of groundwater discharge was concentrated in few zones indicating the possibility of concentrated nutrient or pollutant transport zones from nearby agricultural fields. VTP measurements confirmed high groundwater fluxes in discharge areas indicated by DTS and ADCP, and this coupling of ADCP, DTS and VTP proposes a novel field methodology to detect areas of concentrated groundwater discharge with higher resolution.']"

Twenty six surface water, shallow and deep groundwater samples were collected and analyzed for various ionic concentrations as well as oxygen and hydrogen stable isotopic contents. In addition, a total of 20 vertical electrical sounding sites were conducted to investigate layers' thicknesses, resistivities, and to detect the water-bearing layers. Then, 2-D Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) along two profiles in the study area was conducted to get information about the surface water effect on recharge. The stable isotopic composition and the chloride concentrations strongly suggest that the deep groundwater in Abu Madi area is dominated by inland freshwater with a minor seawater component. This groundwater was recharged during the first and the third Holocene humid climatic cycles where the sea surface was about 125 and 25 m below the current sea level, respectively. The brackish nature and higher piezometric surface of the groundwater, as well as the occurrence of vertical low-salinity seawater zone in front of the study area, support the possibility of submarine groundwater discharge. The geoelectrical resistivity surveying, on the other hand, revealed a number of geoelectrical groundwater-bearing layers. The main water-bearing layer in the study area is represented by the sixth geoelectrical layer, which has relatively high resistivity and a considerable thickness being consistent with the hydrogeochemical observations. ERT results point to the presence of shallow water-bearing layers recharged from the surface water drains with low resistivity and surface rain water of moderate resistivity. Results from the hydrogeochemical analyses and the different hydrogeological data are consistent with the high resistivity values of this geoelectrical layer. However, the overall high specific conductance and high sodium hazards indicate that the groundwater in the study area should be carefully treated before irrigation and domestic uses through mixing it with surface irrigation water."", 'The objective of the present study was to assess the deterioration in groundwater quality due to saline water intrusion in the Ad-Darb region of southwestern Saudi Arabia. An integrated approach using geochemical and geophysical methods was applied to assess the extent of saline water intrusion. Geochemical methods involved the determination of main groundwater facies present in the region using Piper and extended Durov plots. The geophysical methods used in the study included seismic refraction (SR), seismic refraction tomography (SRT), vertical electrical soundings (VES), and electrical resistivity tomography (ERT). Two SR and SRT surveys, three ERT surveys, and nine VES surveys were carried out. Piper plot shows that the water mainly belongs to the SO4-Cl type of anionic facies. The Durov plot indicates base ion exchange, linear mixing, and saline water intrusion as the main factors influencing the groundwater chemistry of the area. The TDS increases towards the coast, with values reaching as high as 9000 mg/l. These results confirm the interpretation of the vertical electrical sounding (VES) and electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) sections which indicates the presence of saline water intrusion, with the thickness of the intruded zone increasing towards the sea. The geoelectric resistivity results indicate four geoelectric resistivity layers. The average thickness of upper layer is 2.5 m and the resistivity ranges from 22.5 to 280 Ωm. The P wave velocity of this layer varies from 488 to 787 m/s. The second geoelectric resistivity zone consists of relatively disconnected layers with 10 to 33 m thickness and 52 to 120 Ωm resistivity. The third zone is a low resistivity zone, increasing in thickness westwards towards the sea and with resistivities of 0.3 to 19.5 Ωm. This is the main zone (consisting of unconsolidated Quaternary sediments) affected by saline water intrusion. This zone is intercalated with muddy marine intercalations, as indicated by its low resistivity (as low as 0.3 Ωm) The second and third geoelectric resistivity layer is represented by a single seismic zone with P wave seismic velocities ranging from 1231 to 1524 m/s, indicating the presence of water. The resistivity of the lowest layer ranges from 56 to 822 Ωm and corresponds to the basement. This bedrock layer has seismic velocities varying between 2315 and 3164 m/s.', 'Seawater intrusion is recognised as a major factor affecting the quality of groundwater in coastal aquifers around the world. To determine the occurrence and extent of saline groundwater intrusion prevailing in the Heuningnes Catchment, a 2D resistivity imaging survey was carried out in three sites within the catchment. Eleven resistivity profile lines were conducted using the multi-electrode ABEM SAS resistivity meter system, employing the Wenner Array to map the extent of saline groundwater. A 2D resistivity image was acquired for these resistivity profile lines and the data were processed using Res2DINV software to produce the 2D inverse resistivity models. The interpretation of the resistivity models revealed three resistivity zones. The first zone is characterised by low resistivity (1–3 Ω.m); this represents an aquifer filled with saline water. The second resistivity zone has values ranging from (3–30 Ω.m); this represents a brackish saturated formation. The third resistivity zone denotes a sandy layer/sandstone saturated with freshwater having high resistivity values above 30 Ω.m. Geochemical analysis results of water samples at 11 locations along the electrical resistivity profile lines also suggest high salinity, indicated by high levels of Cl−, Na+, Total Dissolved Solids, and Electrical Conductivity. It is concluded that some parts of the study area are impacted by seawater intrusion, based on the lower resistivity of < 3 Ω.m and ionic ratios which were close to the standard seawater ratios for Na+/Cl− and SO42−/Cl−. In addition, the high ionic ratios of Na+/Cl− and SO42−/Cl− suggest that salinity in the area is a result of dissolution of evaporates and dilution of marine clays rich in sodium. Therefore, salinization in the study area is the result of combined processes. Integration approach proved to be significant in mapping saline groundwater in coastal aquifers. Integrated assessment of resistivity data, ionic analysis and chemical interpretation indicate that the study area is a transition zone from freshwater to saltwater and only few locations are actually impacted by seawater intrusion. The overall groundwater quality is not apt for human ingestion.']"

To develop a strategy for regional scale sustainable management of coastal aquifers, solution of large-scale multi-objective decision models is essential. The flow and solute transport equations are also density dependent, where the flow parameters are dependent on salt concentration; hence, the flow and solute transport equations need to be solved as coupled equations. In a linked optimization simulation model, the numerical simulation model as a predictor of the physical processes need to be solved enormous number of times to be able to identify an optimum solution as per the specified objectives and constraints. This problem becomes even more complicated when multiple objectives are included and the Pareto optimal solutions need to be determined. Therefore, to ensure the computational efficiency and feasibility of determining a regional scale strategy for control and sustainable use of a coastal aquifer, meta-models that are trained, tested and validated using randomized solutions of the numerical simulation models can be utilized. These meta-models once trained and tested serves the purpose of an approximate emulator of the complex numerical models rendering the solution of a complex and large scale linked optimization model computationally efficient and feasible. The optimal groundwater extraction patterns can be obtained through linked simulation-optimization (S/O) technique in which the simulation part is usually replaced by computationally efficient meta-models. This study proposes a computationally efficient meta-model to emulate density reliant integrated flow and solute transport scenarios of coastal aquifers. A meta-model, Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) is trained and developed for an illustrative coastal aquifer study area. Prediction accuracy of the developed ANFIS based meta-model is evaluated for suitability. The meta-model is then integrated with a multiple objective coastal aquifer management model to demonstrate the potential application of this methodology. The optimization algorithm utilized for solution is the Controlled Elitist Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm. Performance evaluation results show acceptable accuracy in the obtained optimized management strategies. Therefore, use of trained and tested meta-models linked to an optimization model results in significant computational efficacy. It also ensures computational practicability of solving such large-scale integrated S/O approach for regional scale coastal groundwater management.', 'A linked simulation-optimization model using artificial neural networks (ANNs) and genetic algorithms (GAs) is developed for deriving multiple objective management strategies for coastal aquifers. The GA-based optimization approach is especially suitable for externally linking a numerical simulation model within the optimization model. However, the solution of a linked simulation-optimization model is computationally intensive, as a very large number of iterations between the optimization and the simulation models are necessary to arrive at an optimal management strategy. Computational efficiency and feasibility for such linked models can be enhanced by simplifying the simulation process by an approximation. A possible approach for such approximation is the use of an ANN model. In this paper, an ANN model is developed initially as an approximate simulator of the three-dimensional density dependent flow and transport processes in a coastal aquifer. A simulation-optimization model is then developed by linking the ANN model with a GA-based optimization model for solving multiple objective saltwater management problems. The performance of the optimization models is evaluated using an illustrative study area. For comparison of the solution results, a multiple objective management model is also solved using embedded formulation and classical nonlinear optimization technique. The comparison of results shows potential feasibility of the proposed methodology in solving multiple objective management model for coastal aquifers. © 2009 ASCE.', 'To date, simulation-optimization (S/O) based groundwater management models have delivered optimal saltwater intrusion management strategies for coastal aquifer systems. At times, however, uncertainties in the numerical simulation model due to uncertain aquifer parameters are not incorporated into the management model. The present study explicitly incorporated aquifer parameter uncertainty into a multi-objective management model for the optimal design of groundwater pumping strategies from the unconfined Bonriki aquifer situated in a small Pacific island country. The objective of the multi-objective management model was to maximise pumping from production wells and minimize pumping from the barrier wells (hydraulic barriers) to ensure that the water quality at different monitoring locations (MLs) were within pre-specified sustainable limits. To achieve the targeted management goal, a coupled flow and transport numerical simulation model of the Bonriki aquifer was developed using the FEMWATER numerical code. The developed three-dimensional numerical model was calibrated and validated using limited available hydrological data. To achieve computational efficiency and feasibility of the management model, the numerical simulation model in the S/O model was replaced with ensembles of Support Vector Machine Regression (SVMR) surrogate models. Each SVMR standalone surrogate model in the ensemble was constructed using datasets from different numerical simulation models with different hydraulic conductivity and porosity values. These ensemble SVMR models were coupled to the multi-objective genetic algorithm optimization model to solve the Bonriki aquifer management problem. The executed optimization model presented a Pareto-front with 600 non-dominated optimal trade-off pumping solutions. The reliability of the management model established after validation of the optimal solution results suggests that the implemented constraints of the optimization problem were satisfied, i.e., the salinity concentrations at respective MLs were within the pre-specified limits. Overall, the results from this study indicated that the developed management model has the potential to address groundwater salinity problems in small island countries.']"

Urban growth impact (expansion of the impervious surface) was added as an additional input parameter in the GALDIT model, and the analyses were performed using GIS. The results indicated that the area of 16.84 km2, found within the proximity of urban settlements and eroded shorelines along with the Kozhikode, Beypore, Kadalundi, and Faroke, falls under very high vulnerability to seawater intrusion with vulnerability index values ranging 24.82 to 29.82. In the southern sector, the area of 16.84 km2 between Elathur and Beypore also falls within very high vulnerability zones. Similarly, the area of 37.01 km2 in Quilandi, Faroke, Puthiyankadi, Panniyankara, and the east sector of Kozhikode municipality is seen as high vulnerability zones with the vulnerability index values ranging 19.84 to 24.82. Seawater intrusion estimated under moderate vulnerability zones is found to occupy 47.85 km2 (vulnerability index values 14.88 to 19.84). The low and very low vulnerability zones cover 65.07 and 48.07 km2, with the vulnerability index values ranging 9.92 to 14.88 and 4.96 to 9.92, respectively. When cross-validated using major hydrochemical parameters, the results indicate a strong correlation between the vulnerability index classes and groundwater physicochemical parameters. The sensitivity analysis carried out indicated that the distance from the shoreline (D), impacts of urban growth (U), and depth to groundwater table above sea level (L) to be highly influencing parameters for seawater intrusion vulnerability in the coastal stretches. The modified GALDIT-U model shows reliable accuracy for estimating and demarcating seawater intrusion vulnerability zones and could act as an efficient tool in the sustainable management of coastal aquifers in an urban environment.', 'Coastal aquifer of northern Sfax (Tunisia) suffers from the high risk to seawater intrusion and the water quality degradation due to the overexploitation. Hence, assessing the study area vulnerability to pollution is highly crucial so as to protect the groundwater resources. The assessment has been performed by applying the GALDIT method using Geographic Information System (GIS) software and multi-criteria evaluation techniques, and the sensitivity analysis approach to evaluate the effect of each GALDIT parameter on the vulnerability assessment. The GALDIT vulnerability map classifies the study area into three vulnerability classes: low vulnerability (30–50), moderate vulnerability (50–70), and high vulnerability (70–90), which represent 5, 30, and 65\xa0% of the study area, respectively. The map illustrates that the coastal zones of the aquifer are the most threatened areas. The sensitivity analysis results show that the aquifer hydraulic conductivity (A) and the thickness of the aquifer (T) represent the determining factors in the modified vulnerability model. The real weight was used to elaborate the modified GALDIT model which was correlated with resistivity values for validation. This study could serve as a scientific basis for sustainable land planning and groundwater management in the study area.', 'This study employed a modified DRASTIC model (AHP-DRASTIC model) and GALDIT model to evaluate the inherent vulnerability of shallow groundwater in Weibei Plain in Shandong Province of China and its vulnerability to seawater intrusion. The AHP-DRASTIC model uses the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to determine the weight of each parameter and reduces the subjectivity of evaluation. The vulnerability map generated by the AHP-DRASTIC model shows four types of vulnerability: high (25.0%), higher (28.0%), moderate (29.7%), and low (17.3%), and the high-vulnerability areas are mainly distributed in the area north of Qingxiang Town and south of Changyi County. The distribution of high-vulnerability areas mainly related to the depth of groundwater table is 4–8\xa0m, and the recharge of rainfall is 100–175\xa0mm/year. The vulnerability map generated by the GALDIT model shows four types of vulnerability: high (33.5%), higher (23.4%), moderate (22.1%), and low (21.0%), and the high-vulnerability areas are mainly distributed in the coastal areas of Hanting District-Zhuli Town, the areas north of Linqu County, and the areas south of Shouguang County. The distribution of high-vulnerability areas mainly related to the distance between these areas and the coast is < 2.5\xa0km, with aquifer thickness > 15\xa0m. Total dissolved solid, NO3−, Cl−, and SO42− are used to verify the accuracy of the DRASTIC model, the AHP-DRASTIC model, and the GALDIT model. The results show that the AHP-DRASTIC model is more suitable for the assessment of inherent vulnerability of shallow groundwater in the study area than the DRASTIC model, and human activities have a major impact on the verification of vulnerability and should be considered when conducting groundwater vulnerability verification. The results of this study can provide grounds for groundwater management and protection and land use planning in the study area and provide new ideas for groundwater vulnerability assessment in coastal areas.']"

Although long studied for its sedimentology, diagenesis, and paleomagnetism, the basin's lacustrine and paleoclimate history has not been well understood, and conflicting interpretations exist concerning the relations of Tecopa basin to the Amargosa River and to pluvial Lake Manly in Death Valley. Previous studies also did not recognize basinwide tectonic effects on lake-level history. In this study, we focused on: (1) establishing a chronology of shoreline deposits, as the primary indicator of lake-level history, utilizing well-known ash beds and new uranium-series and luminescence dating; (2) using ostracodes as indicators of water chemistry and water source(s); and (3) correlating lake transgressions to well-preserved fluvial-deltaic sequences. During the early Pleistocene, the Tecopa basin hosted small shallow lakes primarily fed by low-alkalinity water sourced mainly from runoff and (or) a groundwater source chemically unlike the modern springs. The first lake that filled the basin occurred just prior and up to the eruption of the 765 ka Bishop ash during marine isotope stage (MIS) 19; this lake heralded the arrival of the Amargosa River, delivering high-alkalinity water. Two subsequent lake cycles, coeval with MIS 16 (leading up to eruption of 631 ka Lava Creek B ash) and MIS 14 and (or) MIS 12, are marked by prominent accumulations of nearshore and beach deposits. The timing of the youngest of these three lakes, the High lake, is constrained by a uranium-series age of ca. 580 ± 120 ka on tufa-cemented beach gravel and by estimates from sedimentation rates. Highstand deposits of the Lava Creek and High lakes at the north end of the basin are stratigraphically tied to distinct sequences of fluvial-deltaic deposits fed by alkaline waters of the Amargosa River. The High lake reached the highest level achieved in the Tecopa basin, and it may have briefly discharged southward but did not significantly erode its threshold. The High lake was followed by a long hiatus of as much as 300 k.y., during which there is evidence for alluvial, eolian, and groundwater-discharge deposition, but no lakes. We attribute this hiatus, as have others, to blockage of the Amargosa River by an alluvial fan upstream near Eagle Mountain. A final lake, the Terminal lake, formed when the river once again flowed south into Tecopa basin, but it was likely short-lived due to rapid incision of the former threshold south of Tecopa. Deposits of the Terminal lake are inset below, and are locally unconformable on, deposits of the High lake and the nonlacustrine deposits of the hiatus. The Terminal lake reached its highstand at ca. 185 ± 21 ka, as dated by infrared-stimulated luminescence on feldspar in beach sand, a time coincident with perennial lake mud and alkaline-tolerant ostracodes in the Badwater core of Lake Manly during MIS 6. A period of stillstand occurred as the Terminal lake drained when the incising river encountered resistant Stirling Quartzite near the head of present-day Amargosa Canyon. Our studies significantly revise the lacustrine and drainage history of the Tecopa basin, show that the MIS 6 highstand was not the largest lake in the basin as previously published (with implications for potential nuclear waste storage at Yucca Mountain, Nevada), and provide evidence from shoreline elevations for ∼20 m of tectonic uplift in the northern part of the basin across an ENE-trending monoclinal flexure.""]"

The influence of geological structure on groundwater migration, storage, enrichment and discharge in the study area is clarified from the characteristics of fracture, fold and fracture development. Fracture crushing zone usually has water-blocking effect, while in the influence zone of one or both sides of the fault is often filled with water, and the groundwater discharge zone is easily formed along the development direction of fault zone. Secondary fault is the main structure controlling the deep hot water active channel in the research area. Syncline structure makes shallow fissure water and lower layer water enriched, forming syncline water storage basin. The near East-West tensile and X joint fissures are beneficial for the enrichment of groundwater. According to the main topography and aquifer characteristics, the study area is divided into three main types: intermountain basin, hilly area and karst area. Through the analysis and summary of groundwater occurrence characteristics and laws in each type of area, combined with the feasibility of development and utilization, three groundwater development and utilization modes are summarized: the drilling and pumping model of water storage structure in the intermountain basin, the regulation and storage model of surface spring pool in the hilly area, and the surface underground joint model of the reservoir formation of the depression and the underground river plugging hole in the karst mountainous area. The research results provide a scientific basis for improving the efficiency of groundwater development and utilization in the Wumeng Mountain area and solving the problem of water use in this area.', 'Multiple processes contributing to natural land subsidence in a shallow coastal aquifer near Ravenna (Italy) were identified by analysing the relationships among different data set time series (water table level, rainfall, land reclamation drainage, sea level, etc.) and establishing the correlations with vertical ground motion observed at a high-resolution settlement gauge. Our study highlights the presence of three deformation components related to different processes controlling land subsidence: elastic, delayed-elastic, and irreversible (plastic) components. The elastic and delayed-elastic components are closely related to water table fluctuations that change the effective stress in two portions of the coastal aquifer at a daily (in the sandy unconfined portion) and seasonal time scales (in the layered clay-rich semi-confined prodelta portion), respectively. The irreversible component represents the trend in the land subsidence time series and is due to primary consolidation (pore pressure dissipation) of the fine-grained prodelta levels above where the settlement gauge is located. The amplitudes of the elastic component can be up to 0.2-0.3mm whereas the amplitude of the delayed-elastic component reaches 0.89 mm. The primary consolidation rate of deformation is 0.9mmyr1 and constrains the likely age of prodelta sediments deposition to 1300-2800 years before present. The delayed-elastic subsidence rate has similar magnitude to that due to primary consolidation and is connected to poroelastic effects in the prodelta sequence following seasonal variations in water table. Our findings are important for planning land subsidence management and monitoring strategies especially where the surface aquifer structure is heterogeneous due to different depositional settings. The natural land subsidence rate in the Holocene sediments of the shallow coastal aquifer of Ravenna (North eastern Italy) that we measured in this study accounts for 10 %-20% of the total current land subsidence rate observed in this portion of Ravenna coastal area (10-20mmyr1).', ""In the framework of the PALAEAUX project, three coastal aquifers have been studied in Spain, looking at the possible existence of Pleistocene or Early Holocene fresh groundwater, in addition to the formerly studied Llobregat Delta. They constitute representative situations of the most common coastal aquifers. The main characteristics of these four areas are: • The Llobregat Delta system, studied since 1965, is placed to the southwest of Barcelona (NE Mediterranean coast of the Iberian Peninsula). It is a sedimentary fluvial formation of Pleistocene to recent age, which is representative of small size coastal alluvial formations with the deep confined aquifer open to the sea offshore. Marine sea water penetrated the deep Pleistocene layer during the Flandrian sea-level rise but afterwards relatively high freshwater heads upstream allowed its progressive flushing to the sea through the submarine outlet since 6000-8000 a ago. Freshwater turnover time is shorter than the Holocene duration and it has been renovated due to natural discharge of the aquifer to the sea. The renovation process has recently been accelerated due to intensive groundwater exploitation during the past century. Nowadays, only freshwater a few centuries old remains in low permeability areas of the confined Pleistocene aquifer. • The Donana sedimentary aquifer system corresponds to the ancient estuary of the Guadalquivir River (SW Spain). It contains old saline groundwater that has not been flushed away due to the low freshwater head. In this aquifer 39Ar, 85Kr, 3H, 14C and 13C measurements have been used to ascertain the age structure of several mixed groundwater samples. After correction, the oldest fresh groundwater 14C age is c. 12-15 ka but 39Ar ages point to somewhat younger water. Neither the stable isotope contents nor the recharge temperature calculated from noble gases show a climatic signature for these waters. • The Inca-Sa Pobla carbonate system is the northeast sector of the island of Mallorca. Brackish and salt groundwater in the coastal area has been found along the coastal strip of S'Albufera, displaying what seems a convective-like flow pattern inside the up to 200 m thick aquifer. The most consistent estimated average 14C ages of the mixed water vary between 9 and 13 ka, i.e. Early Holocene-Late Pleistocene. Water 18O and 2H contents do not show a clear climatic signature. • The Amurga volcanic Massif is on the southeast of the island of Gran Canaria. Brackish groundwater is found in the thick phonolite rock sequence. The unsaturated zone can be up to 200 m thick. Groundwater salinity is due to recharge under arid conditions and the influence of marine airborne salts. Groundwater 14C age is possibly c. 11 ka, indicating a Late Pleistocene age water mixture. The small recharge due to aridity and the thick unsaturated zone explains this. Stable-water isotopes show no clear climatic signature.""]"

A streambed point sampling approach was used to quantify fluxes of water and 14 VOCs from groundwater to an urban stream in North Carolina, USA, during summer (June 2015) and winter (January 2016). The approach is unique in coupling measurements of vertical hydraulic conductivity, vertical hydraulic head gradient, and groundwater VOC concentration at each individual sampling point, reducing or eliminating some potential concerns with other Darcian methods for quantifying VOC inputs to streams. Most results were consistent with discharge of two main VOC plumes on opposite sides of the stream. Plume 1 from the west side was dominated by cis-1,2-dichloroethene (cDCE) and vinyl chloride (VC) at mean concentrations of 19 and 11 μg L−1, respectively. Plume 2 from the east side was dominated by benzene (mean concentration 56 μg L−1). Plume 2 was not previously known, and the improved sampling approach allowed VOC discharge from both plumes to be quantified simultaneously. For 13 of the 14 detected VOCs, the mean VOC flux from groundwater to the stream (fVOC) was higher in January 2016 than in June 2015, mainly because groundwater flux was higher in January. The only exception was cDCE, the most abundant VOC in Plume 1, which had mean fVOC values of 9.8 and 9.5 mg m−2 d−1 in June 2015 and January 2016, respectively. Benzene was the most abundant VOC in Plume 2 and had mean fVOC values of 11 and 37 mg m−2 d−1 in June 2015 and January 2016, respectively. High groundwater flux drove almost all the occurrences of high VOC flux. For a given VOC, the flow-weighted mean concentration (with each VOC concentration weighted by the upward groundwater flux at the VOC sampling point) was generally larger than the unweighted mean concentration. Thus, flow-weighting of concentrations gave a more accurate indication of the average VOC concentration in net groundwater discharge to the stream. An estimate of total VOC mass discharge from groundwater to the study reach of the stream, 3.6 kg of VOC per year, was based on the fVOC results and streambed area in the reach. The bulk of this discharge was due to benzene, cDCE, and VC, with individual mass discharges of 2.1, 0.83, and 0.40 kg yr−1, respectively. Estimates of maximum potential VOC degradation in the streambed suggest that the 3.6 kg yr−1 estimate of mass discharge was not sensitive to potential degradation of VOCs in the streambed sediments above the groundwater sampling depth.', 'An investigation of a tetrachloroethene (PCE) groundwater plume originating at a dry cleaning facility on a sand aquifer and discharging to a river showed that the near-river zone strongly modified the distribution, concentration, and composition of the plume prior to discharging into the surface water. The plume, streambed concentration, and hydrogeology were extensively characterized using the Waterloo profiler, mini-profiler, conventional and driveable multilevel samplers (MLS), Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) surveys, streambed temperature mapping (to identify discharge zones), drivepoint piezometers, and soil coring and testing. The plume observed in the shallow streambed deposits was significantly different from what would have been predicted based on the characteristics of the upgradient plume. Spatial and temporal variations in the plume entering the near-river zone contributed to the complex contaminant distribution observed in the streambed where concentrations varied by factors of 100 to 5000 over lateral distances of less than 1 to 3.5 m. Low hydraulic conductivity semi-confining deposits and geological heterogeneities at depth below the streambed controlled the pattern of groundwater discharge through the streambed and influenced where the plume discharged into the river (even causing the plume to spread out over the full width of the streambed at some locations). The most important effect of the near-river zone on the plume was the extensive anaerobic biodegradation that occurred in the top 2.5 m of the streambed, even though essentially no biodegradation of the PCE plume was observed in the upgradient aquifer. Approximately 54% of the area of the plume in the streambed consisted solely of PCE transformation products, primarily cis-1,2-dichloroethene (cDCE) and vinyl chloride (VC). High concentrations in the interstitial water of the streambed did not correspond to high groundwater-discharge zones, but instead occurred in low discharge zones and are likely sorbed or retarded remnants of past high-concentration plume discharges. The high-concentration areas (up to 5529 μg/l of total volatile organics) in the streambed are of ecological concern and represent potential adverse exposure locations for benthic and hyporheic zone aquatic life, but the effect of these exposures on the overall health of the river has yet to be determined. Even if the upgradient source of PCE is remediated and additional PCE is prevented from reaching the streambed, the high-concentration deposits in the streambed will likely take decades to hundreds of years to flush completely clean under natural conditions because these areas have low vertical groundwater flow velocities and high retardation factors. Despite high concentrations of contaminants in the streambed, PCE was detected in the surface water only rarely due to rapid dilution in the river and no cDCE or VC was detected. Neither the sampling of surface water nor the sampling of the groundwater from the aquifer immediately adjacent to the river gave an accurate indication of the high concentrations of PCE biodegradation products present in the streambed. Sampling of the interstitial water of the shallow streambed deposits is necessary to accurately characterize the nature of plumes discharging to rivers. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.', 'Groundwater wells and surface-water storm sewers contaminated with volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) at the former Naval Air Warfare Center (NAWC) site in West Trenton, New Jersey were sampled in 2018 as part of the Navy’s long-term monitoring program. Trichloroethene (TCE), cis-1,2-dichloroethene (cisDCE), and vinyl chloride concentrations were plotted in map view and selected cross sections to elucidate the verti-cal and horizontal extent and distribution of contamination, along with a tabular comparison between 2018 and previous analytical results. The 2018 data showed that the areas of VOC contamination (>1 microgram per liter) decreased slightly on the north and east sides of the NAWC site from previous sampling dates; these decreases are attributed to the influence of the pump-and-treat system, natural attenuation processes, and various engineered bioaugmentation experiments that have occurred onsite. Off-site groundwater samples indicate the VOC contaminated groundwater is likely hydraulically constrained by the pump-and-treat system and appears to not be moving offsite to the south and west of NAWC. Only one offsite well, 50BR, located along the eastern margin of the site, was found to have detectable TCE and cisDCE concentrations, indicating that VOC contamination continues to migrate a short distance offsite to the east. Detectable VOC contamination was found in wells as deep as 200 and 221 feet on both the east and west sides of the NAWC site. Comparisons of present-day data to data from past sampling efforts indicate that TCE concentrations in most wells have decreased slowly over time. Results from surface-water samples indicate that VOCs enter surface water predominantly through the West Ditch drainage system. Concentrations and fluxes of VOCs are higher when groundwater levels are higher, indicating contaminated groundwater discharges into the surface water system. Higher VOC concentrations at the Interceptor site relative to other sites in the West Ditch indicate the contamination in the West Ditch system is likely caused by contaminated groundwater discharging to the West Ditch storm sewer near manhole MH-140 when water table levels are high. The pump-and-treat extraction wells at the former NAWC site were sampled for per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in 2018. The suite of reported PFAS include perfluo-rooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorononanoic acid, and perfluorobutane sulfonate. Concentrations were plotted in map view to determine the areal extent of the PFAS contamination at the site. Extraction well 48BR sampled on the eastern half of the site was found to have PFOS and PFOA concentrations greater than the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection Drinking Water maximum contaminant levels (MCLs), which is consistent with the distribution of highest PFAS concentrations in surface water in the OF-4 storm sewer system that drains that area, as well as previously collected PFAS concentrations in monitoring wells. On the western half of the site, the extraction well 08BR sample exceeded MCLs for PFOA and PFOS and the extraction well 22BR sample exceeded the MCL for PFOA, but samples from all other extraction wells were below the MCLs or other criteria for all PFAS analyzed. Concentrations of PFOA exceeded concentrations of PFOS on the west side of NAWC in both groundwater and surface water, which contrasts with the conditions on the east side of NAWC where PFOS concentrations exceeded PFOA concen-trations. However, this observation was based on a limited number of samples on the west side of NAWC from 2018 and previous years, so more PFAS sampling is needed on the west side to assess this further.']"

The contents of soil labile organic carbon（LOC）fractions and activities of carbon-acquiring enzymes，including 1，4-glucosidase，cellobiohydrolase，peroxidase，and phenol oxidase，were also studied after 30，180，and 510 days of soil transfer. Increased soil salinity had a significant impact on the contents of soil LOC fractions. The increasing soil salinity increased soil microbial biomass carbon and dissolved organic carbon contents，and decreased soil easily oxidized organic carbon contents. As salinity increased，aboveground plant biomass decreased but belowground biomass increased，fungal abundance increased，and bacterial abundance decreased. Activities of the four carbon-acquiring enzymes increased as soil salinity increased. Correlation and regression analysis results showed that carbon-acquiring enzyme activities were regulated by soil Fe（III）/Fe（II）ratios，soil carbon/nitrogen ratios，and soil fungi/bacteria ratios. Overall，when the soil salinity increased from freshwater to oligohaline，plant root oxygen loss and root exudates increased，and the quality of soil organic matter became worse. These changes led to increases in soil carbon-acquiring enzyme activities and decreases in soil LOC contents. The finding indicates that rapid sea-level rise in the future will lead to decline of soil organic carbon storage in historical tidal freshwater wetlands，and the ecosystem function will be threatened.', 'The southern area of Laizhou bay is located by the Bohai sea. There have been three seawater intrusion events in history, and a mass of high concentration saline brine has been buried in its subsurface aquifers. Large - scale exploitation of underground brine resources has been carried out since the 1970s. Brine baysalt has become a pillar industry of local economic development. In recent years, many salt pans become abandoned due to the exhaustion of regional shallow brine resources and the restriction of high cost and market factors of deep brine exploitation. In this context, some salt pans have been reclaimed based on the relevant government policies. Although a series of remediation measures that combining agriculture and engineering have been carried out on the reclaimed land of salt pans, the soil still contains a large amount of soluble salt on account of the influence of perennial baysalt process, moreover, the content of soil nutrients is also extremely low. The high soil salinity has always been the main limiting factor for the sustainable development of agriculture in the reclamation areas of abandoned salt fields. In this paper, soil sampling data of cotton growth period in four key nodes were used to study the spatial distribution characteristics of soil organic matter and soil salinity at different depths in different periods, and to analyze the correlation between them. The two-dimensional spatial distribution map of soil organic matter content and the three-dimensional spatial distribution map of soil salinity in different periods were drawn. The results showed that the variation of soil salinity and organic matter content at different depths in different periods in the study area was large, among which the maximum variation of organic matter content reached 37.3 g/kg and the maximum variation of soil salinity reached 57.2 g/kg, the variation intensity of both soil salinity and organic matter content was moderate. Soil salinity and organic matter content decreased with time change. The correlation between soil salinity and organic matter content in the soil layer of 0 - 30 cm was the highest, the range was from 0.25 to 0.38, but it did not reach the level of significant correlation. The correlation of soil salinity between different layers reached a significant or extremely significant degree. There was a moderate spatial autocorrelation between soil salinity and surface soil organic matter content. Kriging interpolation results showed that the surface soil organic matter content was distributed in a banded manner, the organic matter content increased gradually from west to east in seedling stage and flowering stage. The soil organic matter content in the flowering and boll period was the lowest in the northeast, and the highest in the harvest period was concentrated in the northwest and southeast. The three-dimensional spatial distribution of soil salinity was similar in different periods and different layers, and its spatial distribution characteristics were generally close. The high soil salinity area at seedling and flowering stage appeared in the southeast. The spatial distribution of soil salinity in flowering and flowering period was scattered and patchy.

Runoff into the sea is reduced during the impoundment period as the result of the water-storing process of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, which causes serious seawater intrusion. Soil salinity is a problem due to shallow and saline groundwater under serious seawater intrusion in the YRE. In this research, we focused on the temporal variation and spatial distribution characteristics of soil salinity in the YRE using geostatistics combined with proximally sensed information obtained by an electromagnetic induction (EM) survey method in typical years under the impoundment of the TGR. The EM survey with proximal sensing method was applied to perform soil salinity survey in field in the Yangtze River Estuary, allowing quick determination and quantitative assessment of spatial and temporal variation of soil salinity from 2006 to 2017. We developed regional soil salinity survey and mapping by coupling limited laboratory data with proximal sensed data obtained from EM. We interpreted the soil electrical conductivity by constructing a linear model between the apparent electrical conductivity data measured by an EM 38 device and the soil electrical conductivity (EC) of soil samples measured in laboratory. Then, soil electrical conductivity was converted to soil salt content (soil salinity g kg−1) through established linear regression model based on the laboratory data of soil salinity and soil EC. Semivariograms of regional soil salinity in the survey years were fitted and ordinary kriging interpolation was applied in interpolation and mapping of regional soil salinity. The cross-validation results showed that the prediction results were acceptable. The soil salinity distribution under different survey years was presented and the area of salt affected soil was calculated using geostatistics method. The results of spatial distribution of soil salinity showed that soil salinity near the riverbanks and coastlines was higher than that of inland. The spatial distribution of groundwater depth and salinity revealed that shallow groundwater and high groundwater salinity influenced the spatial distribution characteristics of soil salinity. Under long-term impoundment of the Three Gorges Reservoir, the variation of soil salinity in different hydrological years was analyzed. Results showed that the area affected by soil salinity gradually increased in different hydrological year types under the impoundment of the TGR.']"

Microbial communities in subsurface horizons are impacted by a saltwater–freshwater transition zone formed by seawater intrusion (SWI) in coastal regions. The main purpose of this study is to explore the changes in microbial communities within the soil profile because of SWI. The study characterizes the depth-dependent distributions of bacterial and archaeal communities through high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons by collecting surface soil and deep core samples at nine soil depths in Longkou City, China. The results showed that although microbial communities were considerably impacted by SWI in both horizontal and vertical domains, the extent of these effects was variable. The soil depth strongly influenced the microbial communities, and the microbial diversity and community structure were significantly different (p < 0.05) at various depths. Compared with SWI, soil depth was a greater influencing factor for microbial diversity and community structure. Furthermore, soil microbial community structure was closely related to the environmental conditions, among which the most significant environmental factors were soil depth, pH, organic carbon, and total nitrogen.', 'The microbial community plays an important role in the biogeochemical cycle in coastal groundwater ecosystems. However, the composition and controlling factors of the microbial community in coastal closed groundwater systems (CCGSs) with high salinity have rarely been studied. Here, we investigated and analyzed the hydrochemical characteristics and microbial community composition of seven brine samples with high total dissolved solid (TDS) values ranging from 74.5 to 132.3\xa0g/L within and across three coastal saltworks (Yangkou, Hanting, and Changyi) in southern Laizhou Bay (SLB). The bacterial diversity was independent of salinity. Compared with those of low-salinity groundwater, the diversity of the microbial community in brine was lower, but the richness was slightly higher. There was a significant correlation between the microbial community diversity and groundwater sources, which indicated that the microbial communities were affected by groundwater sources. A comparison of the microbial community compositions of the three saltworks showed that the Hanting and Changyi saltworks had similar microbial communities due to their similar sampling depths. In addition, the main force shaping the differences in the microbial communities in both coastal open groundwater systems (COGSs) and CCGSs was identified as the hydraulic connection with the seawater controlled by hydrogeological conditions formed throughout geological history. This study can help to elucidate the biogeochemical processes in coastal aquifers.', 'The salinization process of groundwater caused by seawater intrusion is one of the major natural disasters in coastal areas. It generates a salt-fresh water interface with a strong physicochemical gradient, which seriously affects the original ecological environment. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of the diversity and community structure of microorganisms in aquifers affected by seawater intrusion is essential to reveal the environmental impact of seawater intrusion on in-situ microbial communities. Here, we utilized high-throughput sequencing-based microbial community analysis to characterize the diversity and composition of prokaryotic microbial communities and explore the response of microbial communities to the brackish aquifers subjected to seawater intrusion. The results showed that there were 47 prokaryotic microbial groups in the groundwater of the study area. Proteobacteria was the most abundant, followed by Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes, whereas the community structure of Archaea was dominated by Thaumarchaeota and Euryarchaeota which were more enriched in high concentration saline water. The common OTUs in microbial communities of different salinity gradients accounted for 59%, and there were abundant anaerobic microorganisms of genera Desulfovibrio and Methanococcus in some high concentration saline water. Although the variation of microbial diversity was not completely in parallel with the salinity gradient, the diversity increased with increasing salinity with total dissolved solids (TDS) above 1 g/L. A vector fit of possible explanatory environmental factors highlighted that TDS and TN were the most significant factors for the separation of microbial assemblages along the salinity gradients. It should be noted that high levels of ammonia nitrogen in the aquifer may affect the ecological balance to a certain extent. This study provided a foundation for further study of microbial community structure and environmental interaction in underground saltwater.']"

Here we compare physically based model predictions for an Indiana stream with stream tracer results interpreted using the Transient Storage Model (TSM). We parameterized the physically based, Multiscale Model (MSM) of stream-groundwater interactions with measured stream planform and discharge, stream velocity, streambed hydraulic conductivity and porosity, and topography of the streambed at distinct spatial scales (i.e., ripple, bar, and reach scales). We predicted hyporheic exchange fluxes and hyporheic residence times using the MSM. A Continuous Time Random Walk (CTRW) model was used to convert the MSM output into predictions of in stream solute transport, which we compared with field observations and TSM parameters obtained by fitting solute transport data. MSM simulations indicated that surface-subsurface exchange through smaller topographic features such as ripples was much faster than exchange through larger topographic features such as bars. However, hyporheic exchange varies nonlinearly with groundwater discharge owing to interactions between flows induced at different topographic scales. MSM simulations showed that groundwater discharge significantly decreased both the volume of water entering the subsurface and the time it spent in the subsurface. The MSM also characterized longer timescales of exchange than were observed by the tracer-injection approach. The tracer data, and corresponding TSM fits, were limited by tracer measurement sensitivity and uncertainty in estimates of background tracer concentrations. Our results indicate that rates and patterns of hyporheic exchange are strongly influenced by a continuum of surface-subsurface hydrologic interactions over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales rather than discrete processes. © 2012.

All Rights Reserved.', 'Many studies have investigated the exchange processes that occur between rivers and groundwater systems and have successfully quantified the water fluxes involved. Specifically, these exchange processes include hyporheic exchange, river-aquifer exchange (groundwater discharge and river loss) and bank storage exchange. Remarkably, there are relatively few examples of field studies where more than one exchange process is quantified, and as a consequence, the relationships between them are not well understood. To compare the relative magnitudes of these common exchange processes, we have collected data from 54 studies that have quantified one or more of these exchange flux types. Each flux value is plotted against river discharge at the time of measurement to allow the different exchange flux types to be compared. We show that there are positive relationships between the magnitude of each exchange flux type and increasing river discharge across the different studies. For every one order of magnitude increase in river discharge, the hyporheic, river-aquifer and bank storage exchange fluxes increase by factors of 2.7, 2.9 and 2.5, respectively. On average, hyporheic exchange fluxes are almost an order of magnitude greater than river-aquifer exchange fluxes, which are, in turn, approximately four times greater than bank storage exchange fluxes for the same river discharge. Unless measurement approaches that can distinguish between different types of exchange flux are used, there is potential for hyporheic exchange fluxes to be misinterpreted as river-aquifer exchange fluxes, with possible implications for water resource management decisions.', 'The hyporheic zone has received significant attention in recent years due to its role in regulating the physical, chemical, and biological processes that buffer fluvial systems at a variety of scales. The exchange of water through the hyporheic zone is also important for the regulation of stream and streambed temperatures. Recent research has utilized stream and streambed temperatures to quantify groundwater discharge to streams using a variety of methods, including one-dimensional analytical solutions for vertical flux across the streambed interface. The presence of lateral flows, including hyporheic flow, will cause uncertainty in these analytical solution results. In this study, HydroGeoSphere, a three-dimensional, fully integrated surface/subsurface hydrologic model, is used to simulate the manner in which streambed heterogeneity influences groundwater/surface water interactions along a stream section, and the uncertainty of groundwater/ surface water flux estimates based upon streambed temperatures. Groundwater/surface water exchange fluxes from numerical experiments of an idealized linear reach with homogeneous and heterogeneous streambed materials are compared to the results of a one-dimensional analytical solution of groundwater discharge to a stream using the numerically simulated temperature results. Both low- and high-variance distributions of hydraulic conductivity (ln K variances of 0.85 and 17.0, respectively) along the streambed caused hyporheic flow, which caused significant discrepancies between the numerical and analytical groundwater/surface water flux results. A low variance in hydraulic conductivity did result in smaller discrepancies between the numerical and analytical solutions compared to the higher-variance simulations; however, the discrepancies between the low-K-variance simulations and the associated analytical solution interpretation still differed by up to an order in magnitude. The quantity of hyporheic flow increased with increased depth of heterogeneous streambed sediments, causing greater discrepancies between the analytical estimate and the numerical solution of groundwater/surface water exchange. In all simulations the analytical solution underestimated the exchange flux, and in the presence of hyporheic flow, the analytical solution was unable to capture the patterns of exchange flux at the streambed. The three-dimensional modeling approach produced an increase in the lateral flow components within the streambed compared to results inferred from one- and two-dimensional models employed in previous research. This threedimensional approach enabled analysis of the spatial variability of error between the analytical and numerical results and determined that in environments with lateral flows, including hyporheic flow, the analytical solution is indicative of the patterns of the vertical component of fluid flow to the streambed. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.']"

Mixing of such waters in coastal carbonate aquifers could lead to significant amounts of limestone dissolution. The potential for such dissolution in coastal saltwater mixing zones is analyzed by coupling the results from a reaction simulation model (PHREEQE) with a variable density groundwater flow and solute transport model. Idealized cross sections of coastal carbonate aquifers are simulated to estimate the potential for calcite dissolution under a variety of hydrologic and geochemical conditions. Results show that limestone dissolution in mixing zones is strongly dependent on groundwater flux and nearly independent of the dissolution kinetics of calcite. The amount of dissolution varies within a mixing zone, depending on the properties, physical dimensions, and boundary conditions of the aquifer system. Nearly all of the dissolution occurs in the fresher side of the mixing zone, with the maximum dissolution occurring in water that is fresher than that predicted solely by geochemical reaction models. The greatest porosity and permeability development occur at the toe and at the top of the mixing zone. If permeability increases as porosity increases, asymmetry in the dissolution causes the mixing zone to migrate landward over time. Dissolution rates indicated by the model show that this mechanism can produce significant increases in porosity and permeability over time spans on the order of tens of thousands of years. Given the comparatively long span of geologic time, this process may be largely responsible for porosity and permeability development observed in those carbonate rocks through which a freshwater‐saltwater mixing zone had at one time migrated.

The result is a complex nonlinear coupled set of differential transport-advection equations, which need high computational efforts. However, if dissolution rates of calcite are sufficiently fast, such that one can assume the solution to be in equilibrium with respect to calcite a highly simplified modelling approach can be used. To calculate initial changes of porosity in the rock matrix one only needs to solve the advection-transport equation for salinity s in the freshwater lens and its transition zone below the island. Current codes on density driven flow such as SEAWAT can be used. To obtain the dissolution capacity of the mixed saltwater-freshwater solutions the calcium equilibrium concentration ceq(s) is obtained as a function of salinity by PHREEQC-2.

This modelling approach is employed to porosity evolution in homogeneous and heterogeneous carbonate islands and coastal aquifers. The geometrical patterns of porosity changes and the reasons of their origin will be discussed in detail. The results reveal initial changes of porosity in the order of several 10-6 per year. This places the time scale of cavern evolution to orders from several tens of thousands to a hundred thousand years.', 'Dissolution of calcium carbonate in the saltwater-freshwater mixing zone in carbonate islands and coastal aquifers up to now has been treated by coupling geochemical equilibrium programmes to a reactive-transport model.

This approach does no longer require large dispersivities on the order of meters; but reasonable results are obtained with dispersivity on the scale of the pore size of the porous rock, which correctly describes mixing on the molecular scale. The method is applied to a simple 1-D-domain without convective flow and a constant gradient of salinity as presented by Rezaei et al. [Rezaei, M., Sanz, E., Raeisi, E., Ayora, C.

Therefore, understanding the local-scale impact of global climate change on hydrology and water balance is crucial. This study focuses on assessing the impact of climate change on water balance components (precipitation, surface runoff, groundwater flow, percolation, etc.) at the river basin scale in a humid tropical region. The Periyar river basin (PRB) in Kerala in India is considered as a case study and the SWAT hydrological model is adopted to obtain the water balance components. Three general circulation models are considered under two shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP 245 and SSP 585) emission scenarios assess the impact of climate change until 2100. For the PRB, the results demonstrate a significant increase in streamflow (>65%) and runoff (>40%) in the mid (2041–2070) and far (2071–2100) future under both the SSP scenarios, indicating a potential vulnerability to future floods. Conversely, in the near future under SSP 585, a decrease in runoff (−15%) and nominal changes in streamflow (−5%) are observed. Spatially, the eastern sub-basins and the west coast of the Periyar river basin are projected to experience higher precipitation events, while the central region faces reduced precipitation and low flow rates. The findings emphasize the need for proactive and sustainable management of water resources, considering irrigation requirements, groundwater discharge, and flood control measures, to mitigate the negative effects of climate change and prevent water stress/surplus situations in specific sub-basins. This study enhances our understanding of climate change impacts on water balance and emphasizes the significance of sustainable water resource management for an effective response. By integrating scientific knowledge into policy and management decisions, we can strive towards a resilient water future within a changing climate.', 'The changing availability of freshwater resources is likely to be one of the most important consequences of projected 21st century climate change for both human and natural systems. However, substantial uncertainty remains regarding the precise impacts of climate change on water resources, due in part due to uncertainty in GCM projections of climate change. Here we explore the potential impacts of climate change on freshwater resources in a humid, tropical catchment (the River Mitano) in the Upper Nile Basin of Uganda. Uncertainty associated with GCM structure and climate sensitivity is explored, as well as parameter specification within hydrological models. These aims are achieved by running pattern-scaled output from seven GCMs through a semi-distributed hydrological model of the catchment (developed using SWAT). Importantly, use of pattern-scaled GCM output allows investigation of specific thresholds of global climate change including the purported 2 °C threshold of ""dangerous"" climate change. In-depth analysis of results based on the HadCM3 GCM climate scenarios shows that annual river discharge first increases, then declines with rising global mean air temperature. A coincidental shift from a bimodal to unimodal discharge regime also results from a projected reduction in baseflow (groundwater discharge). Both of these changes occur after a 4 °C rise in global mean air temperature. These results are, however, highly GCM dependent, in both the magnitude and direction of change. This dependence stems primarily from projected differences in GCM scenario precipitation rather than temperature. GCM-related uncertainty is far greater than that associated with climate sensitivity or hydrological model parameterisation. © 2010 Author(s).', 'The increasing evidence of climate change motivates the need of quantifying its impacts on groundwater resources and their associated ecosystems to minimize its negative effects. Climate change is expected to produce an increase in temperature and a decrease in precipitation in many places of the Iberian Peninsula. These changes will reduce the groundwater resources. The rise of the sea level in coastal aquifers is an additional threat to groundwater resources. The effects of climate change in the groundwater resources of the Plana de La Galera and Tortosa alluvial aquifers near the Ebre River Delta have been evaluated with water balance and groundwater flow models and three regional climate models by taking into account simultaneously the reduction of groundwater recharge and the rising of the Mediterranean Sea level. The models were calibrated with historic data from 1998 to 2008 and then used to simulate the impacts of climate change in groundwater levels in the simulation periods 2020–2050 and 2069–2099. The climate models predict an increase in average temperature and a decrease in rainfall in the simulation periods 2020–2050 and 2069–2099 compared to the control period 1960–1990. Consequently, the mean annual recharge in the Plana de La Galera aquifer will decrease 23\xa0% in the period 2020–2050 and 27\xa0% in the period 2069–2099 compared to the mean annual recharge in the control period 1960–1990. The recharge in the Tortosa alluvial aquifer will decrease 22\xa0% in the period 2020–2050 and 31\xa0% in the period 2069–2099. The predicted changes in recharge vary significantly from rain-fed to irrigated (drip and flood) areas. In rain-fed areas, the decrease in groundwater recharge is approximately equal to the decrease in precipitation. According to the models here developed, the reduction in recharge will lead to a significant lowering of hydraulic heads in the recharge areas of the Plana de La Galera aquifer for the period 2069–2099. Near the Ebre River Delta, however, groundwater heads will increase slightly due to the rise of the mean sea level.']"

During seawater intrusion into the coastal aquifer, boron is adsorbed to the sediment, and its concentration is reduced with respect to seawater. This study aims to quantify the advantages of using SGW for RO desalination that result from lower boron concentration, stable temperature, and lower salinity as compared to seawater desalination. Firstly, SGW from the coastal aquifer in Israel was sampled and analyzed chemically, and desalination experiments were conducted to calibrate and validate an RO membrane transport simulation code. Secondly, simulations of a large-scale desalination plant (60 million m3 y-1) that uses seawater and SGW as feed were performed. Results show that due to the lower boron concentration in SGW, lower capacity for the 2nd (boron removal) pass of desalination is needed, which saves 21% of the 2nd pass volume compared with seawater. An environmental techno-economic analysis shows that using SGW for desalination (compared with seawater) reduces the operational energy and costs by 17% (∼$4 million per year). Overall, SGW desalination is found to be energy and cost-efficient compared with seawater desalination, and thus, reduces the process environmental load. This journal is', 'The Granot inland BWRO (brackish water reverse osmosis) desalination plant is a part of the Aquifer Rehabilitation Project, which aims to prevent the salinization of the Israeli coastal aquifer. The main flow gradient of groundwater in the region is from a brackish aquifer in the east, to one of Israel’s main freshwater aquifers (the coastal aquifer) in the west. To prevent salinization of the freshwater aquifer, a buffer zone has been created in-between the two aquifers, comprised of approximately 40 wells. These wells act as a barrier to salinization by pumping the brackish water before it reaches the coastal aquifer. This brackish water feeds the Granot BWRO and Lahat BWRO desalination plants. This aquifer rehabilitation project consists of three main parts: (1) a line of wells along the boundary between the two aquifers, (2) the BWRO desalination plants, and (3) a unique, exceptionally long (30 km) brine disposal pipeline to the Mediterranean Sea. From the outset, this project was designed to accommodate expansions in the production capacity of the system as well as to cope with increasing salinity of the source water. Accordingly, since 2004 there has been a gradual expansion over the years, in the number of desalination units within the Granot Plant. Currently, three desalination units are in operation, and a fourth unit is targeted to initiate production in June 2015. The total capacity at the Granot plant will be 41,600 m3d-1 in 2015, and subsequent to the planned fifth unit, production is expected to reach 52,900 m3d-1. This paper discusses the optimal design of the desalination plant, including considerations of RO membrane type, configuration, and post-treatment processes. This design is chosen to meet the permeate water quality regulations, and to minimize energy consumption. The design and construction of the Granot Plant meets all of the regulations of the Israeli Water Authority and the Israeli Ministry of Health, including respective boron and chloride concentration limits in the permeate, of 0.35 ppm and 20 ppm, respectively. Mekorot has also overcome several issues in the design phase as a result of an expected increase TDS and silica concentrations which might increase the scaling tendency. TDS and silica concentrations (and consequently, scaling) are expected to increase further by more than 20% during the coming decade. Experiments were carried out to address the challenge of preventing scaling on the RO membrane and within the brine disposal pipeline. These experiments have led to adjustments in the design features of the desalination units, including the operational conditions and chemical usage.', 'Reverse osmosis (RO) seawater desalination is a widely applied technological process to supply potable water worldwide. Recently, saline groundwater (SGW) pumped from beach wells in coastal aquifers that penetrate beneath the freshwater-seawater interface is considered as a better alternative water source to RO seawater desalination as it is naturally filtered within the sediments which reduces membrane fouling and pre-treatment costs. The SGW of many coastal aquifers is anoxic – and thus, in a low redox stage – has elevated concentrations of dissolved manganese, iron and sulfides. We studied the influence of the SGW redox stage and chemistry on the performance - permeate flux and fouling properties - of RO desalination process. SGWs from three different coastal aquifers were sampled and characterized chemically, and RO desalination experiments were performed under inert and oxidized conditions. Our results show that all three aquifers have anoxic saline groundwater and two of them have intensive anaerobic oxidation of organic matter. Two aquifers were found to be in the denitrification stage or slightly lower and the third one in the sulfate reduction stage. Our results indicate that the natural redox stage of SGWs from coastal aquifers affects the performance of RO desalination. All SGW types showed better RO performance over seawater desalination. Furthermore, air oxidation of the SGW was accompanied with pH elevation, which increased the membrane fouling. Hence, keeping the feed water unexposed to atmospheric conditions for maintaining the natural reducing stage of the SGW is crucial for low fouling potential. The observed benefits of using naturally reduced SGW in RO desalination have significant implications for reduction in overall process costs.']"

Understanding and managing the present-day distribution and future development of these reserves and their hydrochemical characteristics therefore requires insight into their complex evolution history. In this paper, we construct a paleo-hydrogeological model, together with groundwater age and origin calculations, to simulate, study and evaluate the evolution of groundwater salinity in the coastal area of the Netherlands throughout the last 8.5 kyr of the Holocene. While intended as a conceptual tool, confidence in our model results is warranted by a good correspondence with a hydrochemical characterization of groundwater origin. Throughout the modeled period, coastal groundwater distribution never reached equilibrium with contemporaneous boundary conditions. This result highlights the importance of historically changing boundary conditions in shaping the present-day distribution of groundwater and its chemical composition. As such, it acts as a warning against the common use of a steady-state situation given present-day boundary conditions to initialize groundwater transport modeling in complex coastal aquifers or, more general, against explaining existing groundwater composition patterns from the currently existing flow situation. The importance of historical boundary conditions not only holds true for the effects of the large-scale marine transgression around 5 kyr BC that thoroughly reworked groundwater composition, but also for the more local effects of a temporary gaining river system still recognizable today. Model results further attest to the impact of groundwater density differences on coastal groundwater flow on millennial timescales and highlight their importance in shaping today's groundwater salinity distribution. We found free convection to drive large-scale fingered infiltration of seawater to depths of 200 m within decades after a marine transgression, displacing the originally present groundwater upwards. Subsequent infiltration of fresh meteoric water was, in contrast, hampered by the existing density gradient. We observed discontinuous aquitards to exert a significant control on infiltration patterns and the resulting evolution of groundwater salinity. Finally, adding to a long-term scientific debate on the origins of groundwater salinity in Dutch coastal aquifers, our modeling results suggest a more significant role of pre-Holocene groundwater in the present-day groundwater salinity distribution in the Netherlands than previously recognized. Though conceptual, comprehensively modeling the Holocene evolution of groundwater salinity, age and origin offered a unique view on the complex processes shaping groundwater in coastal aquifers over millennial timescales."", 'Seasonal variations in sea level are often neglected in studies of coastal aquifers; however, they may have important controls on processes such as submarine groundwater discharge, sea water intrusion, and groundwater discharge to coastal springs and wetlands. We investigated seasonal variations in salinity in a groundwater-fed coastal wetland (the RAMSAR listed Piccaninnie Ponds in South Australia) and found that salinity peaked during winter, coincident with seasonal sea level peaks. Closer examination of salinity variations revealed a relationship between changes in sea level and changes in salinity, indicating that sea level-driven movement of the fresh water-sea water interface influences the salinity of discharging groundwater in the wetland. Moreover, the seasonal control of sea level on wetland salinity seems to override the influence of seasonal recharge. A two-dimensional variable density model helped validate this conceptual model of coastal groundwater discharge by showing that fluctuations in groundwater salinity in a coastal aquifer can be driven by a seasonal coastal boundary condition in spite of seasonal recharge/discharge dynamics. Because seasonal variations in sea level and coastal wetlands are ubiquitous throughout the world, these findings have important implications for monitoring and management of coastal groundwater-dependent ecosystems.', 'Groundwater discharge is an important mechanism through which fresh water and associated solutes are delivered to the ocean. Permafrost environments have traditionally been considered hydrogeologically inactive, yet with accelerated climate change and permafrost thaw, groundwater flow paths are activating and opening subsurface connections to the coastal zone. While warming has the potential to increase land-sea connectivity, sea-level change has the potential to alter land-sea hydraulic gradients and enhance coastal permafrost thaw, resulting in a complex interplay that will govern future groundwater discharge dynamics along Arctic coastlines. Here, we use a recently developed permafrost hydrological model that simulates variable-density groundwater flow and salinity-dependent freeze-thaw to investigate the impacts of sea-level change and land and ocean warming on the magnitude, spatial distribution, and salinity of coastal groundwater discharge. Results project both an increase and decrease in discharge with climate change depending on the rate of warming and sea-level change. Under high warming and low sea-level rise scenarios, results show up to a 58% increase in coastal groundwater discharge by 2100 due to the formation of a supra-permafrost aquifer that enhances freshwater delivery to the coastal zone. With higher rates of sea-level rise, the increase in discharge due to warming is reduced to 21% as sea-level rise decreased land-sea hydraulic gradients. Under lower warming scenarios for which supra-permafrost groundwater flow was not established, discharge decreased by up to 26% between 1980 and 2100 for high sea-level rise scenarios and increased only 8% under low sea-level rise scenarios. Thus, regions with higher warming rates and lower rates of sea-level change (e.g. northern Nunavut, Canada) will experience a greater increase in discharge than regions with lower warming rates and higher rates of sea-level change. The magnitude, location and salinity of discharge have important implications for ecosystem function, water quality, and carbon dynamics in coastal zones.']"

During the dry season (November–April) the lake drains through a tributary to the Mekong River. The flow in the connecting tributary completely reverses during the wet monsoon (May–October), adding huge volumes of water back to the lake, increasing its area about six fold. The lake is likely phosphorus limited and we hypothesized that groundwater discharge, including recirculated lake water, may represent an important source of P and other nutrients. To address this question, we surveyed hundreds of kilometers of the lake for natural 222Rn (radon), temperature, conductivity, GPS coordinates and water depth. All major inorganic nutrients and phosphorus species were evaluated by systematic sampling throughout the lake. Results showed that there were radon hotspots, all at the boundaries between the permanent lake and the floodplain, indicating likely groundwater inputs. A radon mass balance model indicates that the groundwater flow to Tonle Sap Lake is approximately 10\xa0km3/yr, about 25% as large as the floodwaters entering from the Mekong River during the wet monsoon. Our results suggest that the groundwater-derived dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) contribution to Tonle Sap is more than 30% of the average inflows from all natural sources. Since the productivity of the lake appears to be phosphorus limited, this finding suggests that the role of groundwater is significant for Tonle Sap Lake and perhaps for other flood pulse systems worldwide.', 'Qinghai Lake, the largest lake in China with a surface area of 4260 km 2 , lies in the northeastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) at a mean altitude of 3194 m above sea level. The lake has a water volume of 71.6 × 10 9 m 3 , a salinity ranges of 4.18 ± 0.14 ppt to 12.3 ± 0.14 ppt during sampling period which is about a half of typical seawater. The aquifer systems at the lake shoreline have obvious saline water and freshwater mixing zones with similar hydrogeological and biogeochemical settings to coastal aquifers. This study aims to estimate lacustrine groundwater discharge (LGD) and the associated chemical loadings to western Qinghai Lake. Naturally occurring radium isotopes ( 223 Ra, 224 Ra, 226 Ra and 228 Ra), nutrients, heavy metals and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) were systematically investigated in different water endmembers of western Qinghai Lake. LGD was estimated with radium inventory model and radium eddy diffusion model, leading to a LGD estimate of 7.67 × 10 6 m 3 d −1 and 8.52 × 10 6 m 3 d −1 , respectively. The fresh groundwater discharge obtained based on regional water budget is about 5.97 × 10 6 m 3 d −1 during sampling period, accounting for 73.74% (ranging from 53.22 to 80.43%) of total LGD. This study reveals that the fresh groundwater component is dominant in LGD of Qinghai Lake, which is quite different from most coastal scenarios. Furthermore, the chemical loadings derived from fresh-LGD and recirculated-LGD are evaluated. The preliminary results indicate that fresh-LGD is an important source of nutrient, barium, strontium, uranium, and DIC to the lake, and may significantly impact biogeochemical and ecological processes in the lake. This study presents the first LGD estimate in the largest QTP saline lake in China, and would be instructive to further similar studies in saline lakes in QTP and elsewhere in the world.', 'Poyang Lake is the largest freshwater lake in China and is well known for its ecological and economic importance. Understanding the contribution of groundwater to Poyang Lake is important for the lake’s protection and management. In this study, stable isotopes (δD and δ18O), 222Rn measurements, and corresponding models (222Rn and 18O mass balance models) were employed to evaluate the groundwater discharge and associated chemical inputs to Poyang Lake. The results showed that the distribution of δ18O in the lake water reflects the groundwater discharge into the lake. The groundwater discharge estimated using the 222Rn mass balance model was in reasonable agreement with the groundwater discharge derived from the 18O mass balance model. The 222Rn mass balance model showed that the groundwater discharge rate was 24.18 ± 6.85\xa0mm/d with a groundwater discharge flux of (2.24 ± 0.63) × 107\xa0m3/d, which accounts for 6.52–11.14% of river-water input in the Poyang Lake area. The groundwater discharge flux estimated using the 18O mass balance model was 3.17 × 107\xa0m3/d, and the average groundwater discharge rate was 26.62\xa0mm/d. The estimated groundwater discharge was used to estimate the associated chemical fluxes. It was found that groundwater-derived heavy metals such as iron and manganese are potential threats to the lake ecological system because of their large inputs from groundwater discharge.']"

After the TGP was operated, seasonably adjusted runoff by the Three Gorge Reservoir (TGR) might cause great changes of hydrological regime in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, especially the estuarine areas where seawater intrusion is strong and salt-water environment is complicated. The salt-water dynamics in this region will be greatly influenced in response to the operation of TGP. In order to study the impact of the project on salt-water dynamics and soil salinity, a field experiment has been carried out in the Yangtze River Estuary (YRE). This paper seeks to i nvestigate the influence of the TGR on salt-water dynamics and soil salinity in YRE through the analysis of the relationship between the impact factors of saltwater dynamics in the estuary area. Results showed that the estuarine runoff was closely related to the impoundment process, and the estuarine runoff was one of the most important factors that influenced salinity dynamics of water and soil in the estuary. Results showed that discharge of the TGR was affected by its water storage speed, and runoff at Datong station in the estuary was significantly correlated with the reservoir discharge. The reservoir discharge affected Datong runoff and the lag time of influence of the TGR on Datong discharge is about 8 to 9 days. Runoff at Datong station influenced the river water level in the estuary, and impact of the river runoff on the river water level was delayed around 13 days. The lag time of the influence of the impoundment process of the TGR on the estuarine water level is about 20 days. The discharge decrease of the reservoir reached 3600 m3/s during the impoundment period in 2011, and it would cause about 3500 m3/s flow decline at Datong station with 8 days lag. It will result in 15.6 cm drop in the water level and 4.26 mS/cm increase in river water electrical conductivity (EC) in the estuary, which indicated the increase risk of seawater intrusion intensity in the estuary. Significantly positive correlation between river water salinity and ground-water salinity was also observed, and influence of the river water salinity on groundwater salinity increased gradually from the river bank to the inland. Significant correlation existed between groundwater salinity and soil salinity in different soil layers, with the closest relation in the deep layers. Monitoring results showed that salinity of river water, groundwater and soil under impoundment process performed higher than that of non-impoundment process, and it could be inferred that the impoundment process has a certain impact on the salt-water dynamics and soil salinity in the estuary. In summary, soil and groundwater salinity were affected by the TGR, and risk of soil salinization increased.', ""Climate change and future abstraction regimes will influence the availability of groundwater resources. To alleviate any potential negative effects on aquifer systems and dependent industrial and human uses, it is important to develop long-term water management plans. This study evaluates the effect of climate change and future increased groundwater demand from a coastal aquifer located in Kwale County in southern Kenya. A previously calibrated numerical groundwater flow model has been used as an assessment tool to study how future climate (precipitation and temperature variation) and groundwater abstraction changes will affect the aquifer system. The groundwater flow model was built to simulate the period 2010 to 2017, and eight future model scenarios were developed that cover six hypothetical future years. Future groundwater abstraction has been based on current allocations and future estimates made by Kenya's Water Resources Authority. Future rainfall scenarios have been constructed based on a long historical data series (from 1959 to 2017) and the Standard Precipitation Index. The main results show that future abstraction increases due to economic growth exerts a minimum impact compared with expected climate variability. Recharge depends on intense rain events with important implications for both dry periods and for an average rainfall year. A succession of extended dry seasons may affect all water users. However, the groundwater level decline in the local shallow aquifer can reach five meters, with important consequences for local community water supplies. The most significant groundwater decline in drought periods is observed in the area surrounding the pumping wellfields in the deep aquifers, where the effects of drought and significant abstraction are multiplied. However, the effect of increased abstraction on the shallow aquifer system is limited. Despite groundwater level decline observed during prolonged dry periods, a dry period followed by a humid period leads to the relatively swift recovery of the groundwater system."", 'The arid endorheic basin of northwest China is characterized by rich land resources, water shortage, and a fragile ecological environment. The establishment of a credible coupling model of groundwater and surface water based on multi-source observation data is an effective means to study the change in basin water cycles and the sustainable utilization of water resources in the past and future. Based on the latest understanding of hydrogeological conditions, hydrology and water resource utilization data in the middle reaches of the Heihe River Basin (HRB), this paper constructs an up-to-date coupling model of surface water and groundwater to study the water balance change of the basin. The water resources data series under historical replay and CMIP5 climate model prediction are constructed to predict future changes in water resources. The study shows that, under the joint influence of natural conditions and human activities, the average annual recharge of groundwater in the study area from 1990 to 2020 is 17.98 × 108 m3/a, the average annual discharge is 18.62 × 108 m3/a, and the difference between recharge and discharge is −0.64 × 108 m3/a. The total groundwater storage is −19.99 × 108 m3, of which the groundwater storage from 1990 to 2001 was −17.52 × 108 m3 and from 2002 to 2020 was −2.47 × 108 m3. Abundant water from 2002 to 2020 in the basin significantly improved the loss of groundwater storage. Under the prediction of historical reappearance and the CMIP5 CNRM-CM5 model RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 pathways, the groundwater level of the Heihe River–Liyuanhe River inclined plain falls first because the HRB has just experienced a wet season and then rises according to future climate change. The groundwater level of the inclined plain east of the Heihe River and Yanchi basin decreases continuously because of the change in water cycle caused by human activities. The erosion accumulation plain is located in the groundwater discharge zone, and the water level is basically stable. Under the conditions of water resource development and utilization, the runoff of Zhengyixia hydrological station cannot meet the requirements of the “97 Water Dividing Plan” of the State Council in most years in the future, and the ecological and production water in the lower reaches of HRB cannot be effectively guaranteed. With the implementation of water-saving irrigation under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, the runoff of Zhengyixia can meet the “97 Water Diversion Plan”. It is suggested to further improve the level of agricultural water savings in the middle reaches of the HRB and control the reasonable scale of cultivated land in order to reduce water consumption in the middle reaches of the HRB and implement sustainable utilization of water resources in the HRB.']"

While foreshore beach sand is a potential reservoir for E. coli, there is less understanding of whether it might also be a reservoir and source of phosphorus for adjacent beach waters. We measured levels of E. coli, total phosphorus and soluble reactive phosphorus at Sunnyside and Rouge Beaches in the Toronto and Region Area of Concern, and stormwater outfalls in the adjacent Humber and Rouge Rivers within their beachsheds. Additionally, we used microbial source tracking assays to detect human and gull fecal contamination. Soluble reactive phosphorus concentrations were highest in stormwater outfalls, with concentrations as high as 556 µg l−1 at an outfall in the Sunnyside beachshed, and 4780 µg l−1 at an outfall in the Rouge beachshed. In contrast, the highest total phosphorus concentrations were typically found in foreshore beach sand pore water and were more associated with gull fecal contamination. Beach sand total phosphorus levels were as high as 10,600 µg l−1 at Sunnyside Beach, although the highest total phosphorus concentration measured (25,600 µg l−1) was in a Rouge River outfall. Concentrations of total phosphorus in outfalls were significantly correlated with concentrations of E. coli in both beachsheds and the human microbial source tracking marker in the Sunnyside beachshed outfalls. These results indicate that stormwater outfalls with sewage cross-contamination can deliver high concentrations of total phosphorus, soluble reactive phosphorus and fecal bacterial contamination to associated beachsheds. Further, similar to E. coli, foreshore beach sand can act as a reservoir of total phosphorus and a source for adjacent water bodies via wave action or groundwater discharge. High phosphorus inputs from beach sand could contribute localized changes to microbial communities and unique eutrophication effects along beach shorelines.', 'The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) recently identified the need to improve its capacity for detecting and tracking land-based sources of pollution (LBSP) in coastal waters, particularly microbial contaminants like fecal indicator bacteria (FIB). Reported here is a baseline study of a suite of host-specific FIB microbial source tracking (MST) markers in the coastal shoreline and reef waters around the island of Saipan. Three sampling campaigns were conducted in September 2017, March 2018, and August 2018. Samples were collected from the nearshore surface waters of Saipan, the reef waters of Saipan Lagoon, and groundwater from beaches along the Saipan Lagoon shoreline. Measurements of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) into nearshore waters and isotopic source tracking of nitrogen inputs were conducted concurrently with MST. Environmental DNA was extracted from the samples and analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for MST gene markers of fecal Bacteroidales specifically associated with humans, dogs, cows, and pigs, and for an MST gene marker of Catellicoccus associated with seabirds. MST assessments were combined with local knowledge, assessments of sanitary infrastructure, and routine watershed surveys. This study identified hotspots of human FIB along the western Saipan Lagoon shoreline in both surface waters and groundwater, plus another hotspot of human FIB at a popular tourist bathing area known as the Grotto. FIB hotspots on the Lagoon shoreline coincided with areas of high SGD and nitrogen isotopic data indicating sewage-derived N inputs. It appears that faulty sanitary infrastructure may be contributing to inputs to Saipan Lagoon, while bather shedding is likely a primary input for the Grotto area. Moderate levels of dog fecal contamination were common and widespread across the island. High levels of seabird fecal contamination were more random, both spatially and temporally, and mostly concentrated along the less developed northeast region of Saipan. No significant levels of cow or pig fecal marker were detected in coastal water samples. This study provides demonstration and establishment of analytical capacity to resource management in CNMI for MST technology to aid in trouble-shooting water quality issues involving land-based sources of microbial contaminants to CNMI coastal waters.', 'Fecal contamination in stormwater is often complex. Because conventional fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) cannot be used to ascertain source of fecal contamination, alternative indicators are being explored to partition these sources. As they are assessed for future use, it is critical to compare alternative indicators to conventional FIB under a range of stormwater delivery conditions. In this study, conventional FIB and fecal Bacteroides spp. were monitored throughout the duration of five storm events from coastal stormwater outfalls in Dare County, North Carolina, USA to characterize relationships among FIB concentrations, alternative fecal markers, and loading of contaminants. Water samples were collected multiple times during each storm and analyzed for Enterococcus sp. and Escherichia coli using enzymatic tests and fecal Bacteroides spp. by QPCR. Both conventional FIB and fecal Bacteroides spp. concentrations in stormwater were generally high and extremely variable over the course of the storm events. Over the very short distances between sites, we observed statistically significant spatial and temporal variability, indicating that stormwater monitoring based on single grab-samples is inappropriate. Loading of FIB and fecal Bacteroides spp. appeared to be affected differently by various hydrologic factors. Specifically, Spearman correlations between fecal Bacteroides spp. and drainage area and antecedent rainfall were lower than those between conventional FIB and these hydrologic factors. Furthermore, the patterns of fecal Bacteroides spp. concentrations generally increased over the duration of the storms, whereas E. coli and Enterococcus sp. concentrations generally followed the patterns of the hydrograph, peaking early and tailing off. Given the greater source-specificity and limited persistence of fecal Bacteroides spp. in oxygenated environments, differences in these patterns suggest multiple delivery modes of fecal contamination (i.e. landscape scouring versus groundwater discharge). © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.']"

A heat and mass transport model (SUTRA) was used to evaluate the potential impact of groundwater flow on heat flow along two different regional groundwater flow paths. Limited in situ permeability (k) data from the CRBG are compatible with a steep permeability decrease (approximately 3.5 orders of magnitude) at 600-900 m depth and approximately 40°C. Numerical simulations incorporating this permeability decrease demonstrate that regional groundwater flow can explain lower-than-expected heat flow in these highly anisotropic (kx/kz ~ 104) continental flood basalts. Simulation results indicate that the abrupt reduction in permeability at approximately 600 m depth results in an equivalently abrupt transition from a shallow region where heat flow is affected by groundwater flow to a deeper region of conduction-dominated heat flow. Most existing heat-flow measurements within the CRBG are from shallower than 600 m depth or near regional groundwater discharge zones, so that heat-flow maps generated using these data are likely influenced by groundwater flow. Substantial k decreases at similar temperatures have also been observed in the volcanic rocks of the adjacent Cascade Range volcanic arc and at Kilauea Volcano, Hawaii, where they result from low-temperature hydrothermal alteration. Regional groundwater flow can explain lower-than-expected heat flow in a thick sequence of highly anisotropic (kx/kz~104) continental flood basalts (Columbia River Basalt Group). A steep permeability decrease (approximately 3.5 orders of magnitude) is observed at 600-900 m depth and approximately 40°C, possibly a result of low-temperature hydrothermal alteration.', 'Young gullies and gully deposits on walls of martian craters have been cited as evidence that liquid water flowed on the surface of Mars relatively recently. Effects of variable environmental conditions at the surface of Mars are modeled and applied to the case of groundwater emergence from shallow aquifers to investigate whether groundwater is a viable source to enable the erosion of these gullies. The model includes detailed treatment of ice growth in the aquifer. Model results indicate that groundwater discharge can be maintained under the current environmental conditions if the aquifer permeability is like that of terrestrial gravel or higher, if the aquifer is 350K or warmer, or if the aquifer is a brine with a freezing point depressed to 250K or below. Groundwater discharge cannot be maintained for the conservative case of a cold, pure water, semi-pervious aquifer. Cold (275K) pure water pervious (gravel) aquifers, warm (350K) pure water semi-pervious aquifers, and cold (275K) CaCl2 brine semi-pervious aquifers all exhibit a dependence of discharge on season, latitude and slope orientation in our modeling. Seasonal, latitudinal and azimuthal discharge variations are strongest for cold CaCl2 brine semi-pervious aquifers, with discharges from this aquifer type favoring equator-facing slopes at mid and high southern latitudes. At all latitudes and slope azimuths under our nominal conditions, the cold pure water pervious aquifer, the cold pure water semi-pervious aquifer and the cold CaCl2 brine semi-pervious aquifer all freeze completely shortly after the simulations are started. Discharge restarts in the summer for the cold pure water pervious aquifer and the cold brine aquifer, but discharge does not restart for the cold pure water semi-pervious aquifer. The warm pure water semi-pervious aquifer maintains daily seeps throughout the year at all but high latitudes. In the case of the cold pure water pervious aquifer, approximately 500,000m3 of water could be discharged from a mid-latitude, 150-m thick aquifer with a 20-m wide seepage face orientated towards the equator or the pole after a single undermining-induced event before ice growth seals the seepage face. For a brine semi-pervious aquifer with the same dimensions, 200-300m3 of water could be released from a mid-latitude 20-m wide equator-facing seepage face before the fresh exposure is sealed for the fall and winter seasons. Our results do not rule out groundwater emergence as a means of creating some recent gullies, but they indicate that rather special and perhaps unusual conditions would be required. © 2010.', 'Abstract From the Late Noachian period, through the Hesperian, and into the Amazonian periods on Mars, large outflow channels were formed. Many are interpreted to have originated through the catastrophic discharge of groundwater from martian aquifers, involving the release of up to millions of cubic-kilometers of water. Such a mechanism for outflow channel formation requires that martian aquifers were supplied with significant quantities of water some time prior to the discharge events. Typical groundwater recharge occurs due to the infiltration of surficial waters through a permeable substrate down into aquifers. However, some climate models predict an early martian climate dominated by generally ""cold and icy"" conditions. In this scenario, a globally continuous, impermeable cryosphere prevents infiltration of liquid water (that might be generated at the surface through anomalous heating conditions), leaving the martian aquifers without an apparent source of recharge to supply later outflow channel formation by groundwater discharge. More recent global climate modeling of an early, thicker CO2 martian atmosphere predicts that, when coupled with a full water cycle, the atmosphere of Mars will behave adiabatically causing temperatures to decrease with elevation. The high standing areas of Mars, such as the southern highlands and the Tharsis region, then act as cold traps. This leads to the preferential accumulation of snow and ice, resulting in the formation of regional ice sheets throughout the highlands that characterize the Late Noachian ""icy highlands"" early Mars climate model (LNIH). We make the initial assumption that the LNIH model is representative of the early Mars climate, and seek to test the model against the presence of the Hesperian and Amazonian outflow channels to determine if it can be consistent. In order to reconcile the LNIH early Mars climate model with the presence of the later outflow channels a groundwater recharge mechanism that can operate under the predicted ""cold and icy"" conditions is required. We test basal melting of surface snow and ice in response to a regionally elevated geothermal heat flux throughout the Tharsis rise (resulting from widespread volcanic and magmatic activity during the Noachian) as a mechanism that can provide: (1) liquid water generation at the surface of Mars under generally ""cold and icy"" conditions, and (2) potentially large scale integration of the hydrological system (through thinning or breaching of the cryosphere), allowing for infiltration of meltwater to provide groundwater recharge during the Late Noachian to supply the later formation of outflow channels. We find: (1) Regional scale basal melting of LNIH ice sheets is not likely to occur at the predicted nominal average ice sheet thicknesses, even in the presence of the anomalous bottom-up heating conditions expected in the Tharsis region (although the increased baseline heating will render the LNIH ice sheets more susceptible to melting through additional anomalous heating conditions introduced by top-down and bottom-up processes). (2) Local scale basal melting and groundwater recharge through a ""heat-pipe drain pipe"" mechanism is likely to occur, but is not predicted to produce sufficient groundwater recharge to supply the water needed to form the outflow channels. (3) Under the assumption of an ice saturated cryosphere, regional scale melting of the cryosphere due to the insulating effect of the LNIH ice sheets does not provide enough water to explain the formation of all of the outflow channels. Therefore, if the LNIH model is correct, the groundwater recharge that supplied outflow channel formation requires a source that operated earlier in martian history, or the recharge was supplied by other mechanisms.']"

Quantification of the sources and rates of such discharge requires a ground water seepage meter that provides continuous measurements at high resolution over an extended period of time. An ultrasonic flowmeter has been adapted for such measurements in the submarine environment. Connected to a steel collection funnel, the meter houses two piezoelectric transducers mounted at opposite ends of a cylindrical flow tube. By monitoring the perturbations of fluid flow on the propagation of sound waves inside the flow tube, the ultrasonic meter can measure both forward and reverse fluid flows in real time. Laboratory and field calibrations show that the ultrasonic meter can resolve ground water discharges on the order of 0.1 μm/sec, and it is sufficiently robust for deployment in the field for several days. Data from West Neck Bay, Shelter Island, New York, elucidate the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of submarine ground water discharge and its interplay with tidal loading. A negative correlation between the discharge and tidal elevation was generally observed. A methodology was also developed whereby data for the sound velocity as a function of temperature can be used to infer the salinity and source of the submarine discharge.

The new design replaces seepage meter bags with open-ended tubing through which the displacement of injected dye is a highly reproducible measure of discharge. Laboratory measurements, detailed mathematical modeling of groundwater flow around seepage meters, and parallel field tests of bag and dye displacement seepage meters demonstrated that the new design can improve the precision and temporal resolution of submarine groundwater discharge measurement. In parallel field tests, groundwater discharge to 15 cm diameter, bag-equipped seepage meters was half of the discharge to adjacent 15 cm diameter dye displacement seepage meters. Model results confirm that similar discrepancies, caused by groundwater diversion around bag-equipped seepage meters, may occur during the deployment of 57 cm diameter seepage meters in common field conditions. A second field deployment of 15 cm diameter dye displacement seepage meters showed saline inflow into sandy sediments at high tide and a high rate of discharge at low tide, similar to observations made with far more expensive, open flow path automated seepage meters in other studies.

The progression of approaches in systematic conservation planning from representation to representation and persistence has greatly enhanced its potential applicability to freshwaters. However, conceptual frameworks that consolidate principles for incorporating persistence into freshwater conservation planning are still lacking.2. We present four key principles to consider when planning for the persistence of freshwater biodiversity: selecting ecosystems of high ecological integrity; incorporating connectivity; incorporating areas important to population persistence; and identifying additional natural processes that can be mapped.3. The practicalities of gathering data and conducting the conservation plan to address these principles are explored here using a case study in the Olifants/Doorn Water Management Area, South Africa. Spatial layers are developed for depicting ecological integrity, sub-catchment boundaries, riparian zones and wetlands, high water-yield areas and patterns of groundwater discharge and recharge.4. These data are used to develop a conservation area network that supports both representation and persistence of freshwater biodiversity. Although the planning region is relatively data rich by global standards, several data deficiencies were identified. We suggest ways of using environmental surrogates to address data deficiencies, improving confidence in these surrogates by combining them wherever possible with existing field data and expert knowledge.5. We also recommend methods to achieve spatial efficiency by simultaneously designing for representation and persistence of freshwater biodiversity. Spatial efficiency can be achieved in different ways when using a conservation planning algorithm and a multiple-use zoning strategy.6. The allocation of multiple-use zones aligns closely with the objectives of integrated water resources management and land use planning. Given the practicalities at local levels of planning, we recommend using multiple-use zones in the design phase, rather than merely at the end once the design is complete. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.', 'Karst watershed refers to the total range of surface and underground recharge areas of rivers (including subterranean rivers and surface rivers) in karst areas.

This method aims to solve the inconsistency between the topographical drainage divides and actual catchment boundaries in karst areas. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was modified by replacing the single-reservoir model in the groundwater module with a three-reservoir model to depict the constraints of multiple media on groundwater discharge in the karst system. The results show that the catchment areas beyond topographic watershed were effectively identified after simplifying subterranean rivers to surface rivers based on the modified DEM data, which ensured the accuracy of the basic model. For the calibration and two validation periods, the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiencies (NSE) of the modified SWAT model were 0.87, 0.83, and 0.85, respectively, and R2 were 0.88, 0.84, and 0.86, respectively. The NSE of the modified SWAT model was 0.09 higher than that of the original SWAT model in simulating baseflow, which effectively improved the simulation accuracy of daily runoff. In addition, the modified SWAT model had a lower uncertainty within the same parameter ranges than the original one. Therefore, the modified SWAT model is more applicable to karst watersheds.', ""This paper reports on a conceptual model that was developed to describe the different groundwater discharge 'types' from the Table Mountain Group (TMG) aquifer, that contributes to the different components of the flow regime in each of the recognised river reaches for streams and rivers associated with the TMG. This model integrates hydrogeological, ecological and geomorphological understandings into an ecohydrological perspective linking ground- and surface water systems. Through geospatial intersections of existing GIS layers a GIS model was also developed to highlight the quaternary catchments containing sensitive aquatic ecosystems that could be vulnerable to groundwater use from the TMG. The conceptual model demonstrates the intimate link between groundwater from the TMG aquifer and aquatic ecosystems in the mountain and foothill reaches of streams and rivers in the Cape Folded Mountains in particular. It also identifies two primary zones of interaction between groundwater and surface water in the TMG, namely, the 'TMG aquifer daylight-domain', located in the recharge zone, and the 'TMG aquifer surface water interface-domain', located at the discharge end of the aquifer. The conceptual model clearly indicates the difference between real groundwater, and perceived groundwater contributions to streamflow in the TMG. It is the lower flows of the flow regime that will be most vulnerable to groundwater use from the TMG aquifer in the 'TMG aquifer daylight-domain', which are unfortunately also the most important flows from an ecological perspective. However, any groundwater use from the TMG aquifer will also affect the discharge end of the aquifer, located far from the higher elevation recharge areas, or the point of groundwater abstraction, in lowland settings in the 'TMG aquifer surface water interface-domain'. The GIS model integrated the conceptual understanding into a management tool by highlight all quaternary catchments associated with TMG containing sensitive aquatic ecosystems and gave the variable vulnerability for each.""]"

But interestingly, groundwater in soil salinization area has lower fluorine levels than that in seawater intrusion area although it is more intruded. A seawater intrusion area (Buzhuang Town) and a soil salinization area (Kenli District) were selected along Laizhou Bay, Shandong Province. The sediment fluoride levels and FTIR characteristics were determined to reveal the differences of fluoride evolution in the two areas. The sediment fluoride levels in the two areas are within the safe limit. However, fluoride levels in aquifer sediments in Buzhuang Town (130–272 mg/kg) are extraordinarily lower than those in Kenli District (554–609.8 mg/kg), although Buzhuang Town is characterized by drinking-water fluorosis and Kenli District is not. This indicates Buzhang Town has stronger fluoride leaching-ability in the aquifer sediments than Kenli District, which is the important cause for the high-fluorine groundwater in Buzhuang Town. The sediments in Kenli District have higher intensities of OM (organic matter), OH– and CaCO3 bands than those in Buzhuang Town. The stronger adsorption of OM to F– lowers sediment fluoride-leaching in Kenli District. The more mixture of seawater in Kenli District causes the higher sediment OH–, and the F-O exchange contributes more to fluoride-leaching than OH–F exchange. Moreover, the higher Ca2+ in Kenli District restricts fluoride-leaching and causes higher sediment CaCO3 bands, which is the important factor influencing sediment fluoride-leaching. While the extraordinarily increasing Na+ levels in Kenli District contribute less to fluoride-leaching when the fluoride-leaching is restricted by Ca2+ levels. A model of FTIR evolution in aquifer sediments with the effect of seawater intrusion is forwarded, which is significant for fluorosis along coastal plains.', 'Seawater intrusion and drinking-water fluorosis are frequently documented along coastal plains. Groundwater is characterized by high OH-, Na+, total dissolved solids, and low Ca2+ because of seawater intrusion, and such conditions favor sediment fluoride-leaching and fluorosis. But the geological process of seawater intrusion has not been noticed when high-fluoride groundwater along coastal areas is discussed. The groundwater and sediments in a typical seawater intrusion and fluorosis area are gained, and fluoride-leaching simulation experiments are performed. Sediment fluoride levels are equal to or lower than average sediment fluoride levels in China and Shandong province, but strong fluoride-leaching in aquifers is observed. Compared with the supplied water from the non-intruded neighboring area, the local groundwater has higher fluoride levels, together with higher pH, total dissolved solids, HCO3-, Cl-, Br-, SO42-, Na+, K+, and low Ca2+ because of seawater intrusion. Aquifer sediment fluoride-leaching ability increases with an increase in seawater (brine water) mixing ratios, and NaCl or NaHCO3 levels, but with a decrease in CaCl2 levels. This directly confirms that seawater (brine water) intrusion promotes sediment fluoride-leaching, and the high pH, Na+, HCO3-, and low Ca2+ levels caused by seawater intrusion are responsible for the high-fluoride groundwater along coastal plains.', 'High-fluoride groundwater along coastal plains is frequently documented. The typical geological processes of seawater intrusion and soil salinization both result in conditions of high Na+, HCO3−, Cl−, TDS (Total Dissolved Solid), and the previous related researches argue high-fluoride groundwater is favored in such conditions, together with low Ca2+. But the fluorosis in soil salinization area contrarily does not occur although more seawater mixes, and the region is characterized by higher Na+, Cl−, TDS. Thus, groundwater in Kenli District of soil salinization area and Buzhuang Town of seawater intrusion area was analyzed and compared, to reveal the potential groundwater fluoride evolution. Generally, the groundwater fluoride levels in Kenli District (0.19–1.27 mg/L) are within but those in Buzhuang Town (0.65–9.87 mg/L) are beyond the safe limit. Geochemical properties indicate a direct cation exchange in Kenli District but a reverse cation exchange in Buzhuang Town. The reverse cation exchange results in the decreasing of groundwater Ca2+(Mg2+) and under-saturation of CaF2, MgF2, CaCO3, MgCO3, CaSO4‧2H2O, MgSO4 minerals, which permits more fluoride dissolving and causes high-fluoride groundwater in seawater intrusion areas. However, the direct cation exchange increases groundwater Ca2+(Mg2+) levels to the saturation of CaF2, CaCO3 and MgCO3 minerals, and the high Ca2+ restricts the fluoride dissolution and causes low fluoride groundwater in soil salinization areas. Moreover, the calculated Ca2+, Mg2+ originating from cation exchange (△(Ca2++Mg2+)C) occupies a large proportion because of the high Na+ levels in Kenli District, and is positively correlated with the degree of mixed seawater. The difference of cation exchange processes and orientations in the two areas is confirmed to be the key to groundwater fluoride levels. Moreover, extraordinarily high levels of groundwater Na+ is found to contrarily decrease groundwater fluoride levels because of cation exchange, which is different from the previous observation that Na+ always enhances groundwater fluoride. A new insight into the function of Na+ on groundwater fluoride evolution was proposed. These findings provide some information about groundwater fluoride evolution along coastal plains.']"
